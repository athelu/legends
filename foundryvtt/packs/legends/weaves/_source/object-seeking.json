If object is moving, you learn its direction of movement. Weave can't locate object if any thickness of lead blocks the path.  \n**Saving Throw:** None (scrying)  \n**Success Scaling:** 0 = fails, 1 = 100 feet range, 2 = full effect (1,000 feet), 3 = 1 mile range, 4 = can locate general type of object (e.g., \"stairs\" or \"freshwater\") instead of specific item  \n\n## P"
