    "description": "**Primary Energy:** Positive 4 (soothing emotional turmoil)  \n**Supporting Energy:** Space 6 (medium range + 20ft radius + 1 minute)  \n**Range:** Medium, 60 ft. (20-foot radius sphere)  \n**Duration:** 1 minute  \n**Total Cost:** 10 Energy  \n**Action:** Complex weave (2 actions)  \n**Weaving Roll:** Positive Potential + Positive Mastery / Space Potential + Space Mastery  \n**Effect:** All creatures in a 20-foot radius sphere at medium range must make Will saves. Compare your weaving successes to each target's save successes. Those you beat can choose to be affected (suppressing Charmed or Frightened) or you can suppress hostility (they become indifferent if not directly threatened). Creatures immune to charm are immune to this weave.  \n**Saving Throw:** Will (to resist emotion suppression)  \n**Success Scaling:** 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 round, 2 = full effect (1 minute), 3 = 10 minutes, 4 = 1 hour  \n**Note:** Particularly effective for invokers speaking words of peace and calm"
