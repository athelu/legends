    "description": "The Kuhlar or \"True\" elves live within Llewelyn wood. The Kuhlar are made up of the survivors of the dwarven wars who faced down the dwarven armies as they pushed to the Elven heart tree.\nWith the armies of the dwarves destroyed in the wrath of Athore, the Kuhlar retreated to the heart of Llewelyn wood. Here, like their Haiden brethren, they fought to rebuild what was left of their people. In a heightened state of paranoia and isolationism, the Kuhlar elders sealed the forest around them to all outsiders.\nMagical wards and guards were placed to eliminate any who dared entered Llewelyn wood. In their isolation, the Kuhlar redoubled their dedication to their goddess and vowed to never suffer such a fate again. Over the millennia, Factions began to form within the Kuhlar; some wanting to reconnect with the world at large, others clamoring for vengeance upon any non-elf, while others still longed for isolation.  \nUltimately it was decided that the Kuhlar did need to see what was happening beyond Llewelyn. Agents were groomed and trained to act as spies and informants. The information these agents provided was world changing to the Kuhlar, particularly toward the existence of the Haiden elves. \nFactions cried for the eradication of these elves while others wanted to bring them back to the Kuhlar way, and still others who wanted to join them. The high elders do their best to appease these groups, settling on a path of intrigue and influence, leveraging the Haiden elf community to place Kuhlar agents in places of influence. \n\n---\n\n# Dwarves\nDwarves are a rough and durable race. They are short and stocky and very often have full facial hair. Dwarves are very persistent and tend to choose singular careers and excel in them until they can go no further."
