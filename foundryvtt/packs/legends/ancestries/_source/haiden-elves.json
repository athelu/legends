    "description": "Haiden Elves are the stragglers and refugees left behind after the Dwarven War. The march of the Dwarves destroyed almost all Elven kind and their civilization.\nThe few that were spared fled to safety.  in many cases finding the new cities of Men. Here they were welcomed if a bit warily. Eventually these survivors integrated into this new society, blending parts of their past with this new human culture.\nElves that live within the human nations are typically accepted as regular citizens and have integrated so naturally that there is little Elven culture to distinguish. These elves can benefit from the same Ethnicity options as their human brothers. \nNot being of the same species, mixed marriages can produce no children, so are rare. Elven natural grace and appreciation of beauty finds them many positions in the fine arts. Artist, Poet, Musician and Performer are common occupations for Haiden elves. Many more are accomplished Sorcerers, alchemists, or scholars, with their enviable lifespan allowing them to come to true mastery of these mysteries.\nThere are a group of elves that have reclaimed the land of their forefathers; rebuilding cities and creating their own nation once again. The kingdom of men, particularly the Kingdom of Meresaw helped these elves rebuild, forging an alliance between the two nations that stands today. \nThese elves have more cultural differences from their more human integrated counterparts. Typically, around family structure, traditions, and religious practices."
