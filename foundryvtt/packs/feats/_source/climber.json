      "value": "**Tier:** 2\n**Prerequisites:** Athletics 4, Acrobatics 2\n**Description:** Walls are just vertical floors to you. Falling is still dangerous, of course, but you've gotten good at catching yourself.\n**Benefit:** Climb at full movement speed (no reduction). Can attempt normally impossible climbs (smooth stone, ice, ceilings) with Athletics check (Hard task). When falling during a climb, automatically get Acrobatics check to catch yourself (1 success = catch and stop fall, 2 successes = catch and don't take damage)\n**Usage:** Passive\n**Keyword:** [Skill]"
