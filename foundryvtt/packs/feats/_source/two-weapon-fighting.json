      "value": "**Tier:** 1\n**Prerequisites:** Agi 4, Dex 3\n**Description:** Extensive training with a blade in each hand allows you to maintain a relentless offense that overwhelms defenses. The second strike might not be as clean as the first, but it's still effective.\n**Benefit:** When making dual-weapon attacks in a single [Combat] action, first attack is normal, second attack adds 1 to skill die only (instead of adding to both dice). Both attacks use Shared Attribute Roll\n**Usage:** Passive\n**Keyword:** [Combat], [Dual]"
