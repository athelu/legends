      "value": "**Tier:** 1\n**Prerequisites:** Str or Con 4, Melee 3\n**Description:** Rage sharpens rather than clouds your mind. You have developed a focused, directed fury that makes you hit harder, move faster, and shrug off wounds that would stop others.\n**Benefit:** As 1 [Combat] action, enter Primal Fury for 1 minute: gain temporary HP equal to your Constitution score, +2 damage on melee attacks, +2 DR against physical damage, subtract 1 from both dice on Fortitude saves. Cannot cast weaves while in Primal Fury (all pneuma used to fuel rage). Ends early if you fall Unconscious. Once it ends, you gain one level of Exhaustion. Can only use once per long rest\n**Usage:** Once per long rest, lasts 1 minute\n**Keyword:** [Combat], [Savage]\n\n### Primal Multiattack\n**Tier:** 3\n**Prerequisites:** Primal Fury feat, Melee 5\n**Benefit:** While in Primal Fury, can make two melee attacks as 1 [Combat] action. Use Shared Attribute Roll: roll Attribute once, apply to both attacks. Roll Melee skill die separately for each attack. This counts as 1 action for multiple action penalty\n**Usage:** While in Primal Fury, once per turn\n**Keyword:** [Combat], [Savage]"
