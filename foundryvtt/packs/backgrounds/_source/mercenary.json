Maybe you had an altruistic motive and genuinely believed in your employers' causes, or maybe the coin was motivation enough.

Most of the time, anyway. <strong>Skills:</strong> Melee Combat 2, Athletics 2, Intimidate 1, Wilderness 1, +40 XP <strong>Equipment:</strong> Weapon of choice, common clothes, work boots <strong>Feature</strong> - Soldier of Fortune: You can find mercenary work and may be recognized by other sellswords. Know how to negotiate contracts and identify legitimate employers.</p>"
