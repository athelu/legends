    "description": "- Your location is unknown; enemies do not know which square you occupy\n- Enemies cannot directly target you with attacks or single-target weaves\n- You have significant tactical advantage\n\n**How to Gain Hidden:**\n\n1. **Successful Stealth Check:**\n   - Use Hide action (normally 1 [Combat] action, or 1 [Minor] with Swift Movement feat)\n   - Make Stealth check opposed by observers' Perception\n   - Must have something to hide behind (cover, concealment, etc.)\n   - Success: You gain Hidden condition\n   - Failure: Observers know your location (you may be Concealed but not Hidden)\n\n2. **Invisibility:**\n   - Invisibility weaves grant Hidden condition\n   - Observers cannot see you without magical means\n   - Can still be detected by sound, smell, touch, or environmental clues\n\n3. **Full Cover from All Observers:**\n   - If no enemy has line of sight to you, and you pass a stealth check you are Hidden from them\n   - Example: Behind a wall, around a corner, inside a closed room\n\n4. **Magical Effects:**\n   - Some weaves or abilities grant Hidden condition\n   - Darkness that prevents vision\n\n**Cannot Be Directly Targeted:**\n- Enemies cannot make attack rolls against you (don't know where you are)\n- Single-target weaves requiring line of sight cannot target you\n- Area effects can still affect you if your general area is targeted\n\n**Attacking While Hidden:**\n- You have Fortune on your first attack roll while Hidden\n- Making an attack typically reveals your position:\n  - **Standard:** Attack reveals you, you become visible\n  - **Exception:** Woodcraft feat - ranged attacks from hiding in natural terrain don't automatically reveal position (enemies must succeed Perception check)\n  - **Exception:** Perfect Invisibility - doesn't break when attacking\n\n**Detection:**\nIf an observer succeeds on Perception check to detect you:\n- **Hidden → Visible** \n\n**Ways to Detect Hidden Creatures:**\n\n1. **Active Search [Interact action]:**\n   - Make Perception check opposed by Hidden creature's Stealth\n   - Success: Creature loses Hidden, becomes Visible\n   - Failure: Creature remains Hidden\n\n2. **Passive Perception:**\n   - GM compares observer's Passive Perception to Hidden creature's Stealth result\n   - If Passive Perception equals or beats Stealth, creature is detected\n\n3. **Non-Visual Detection:**\n   - **Sound:** Footsteps, breathing, knocked objects, armor noise (Perception check)\n   - **Smell:** Strong scents, perfume, unwashed (Perception check, often with Misfortune)\n   - **Touch:** Bumping into invisible creature (automatic detection → Concealed)\n   - **Environmental:** Footprints in snow, ripples in water, disturbed fog, moving grass (Investigation or Perception check)\n   - **Magical:** Perfect Sight, tremorsense, blindsight, other special senses\n\n**Maintaining Hidden:**\n- Requires continued stealth\n- GM may call for new Stealth checks if you move (especially if moving quickly or across noisy terrain)\n- Broken if enemies successfully detect you\n- Automatically broken by Revealed condition\n- Broken by most offensive actions (attacks, casting obvious weaves)\n\n**Special Senses:**\n- Creatures with Blindsight can detect Hidden creatures within range reducing their benefit to concealed.\n- Creatures with Tremorsense detect Hidden creatures on the ground reducing their benefit to concealed.\n- Perfect Sight sees through invisibility and illusory effects\n\n**Area of Effect Targeting:**\n- Enemies can target your general area with AOE weaves\n- Example: \"I cast Fireball centered on that cluster of barrels where I heard noise\"\n- You're still affected if you're in the area, even though they can't target you directly\n\n**Duration:** \n- Until revealed, you attack, or conditions change\n- Revealed condition immediately ends Hidden\n\n**Example Situations:**\n- Successfully hiding behind a pillar during combat\n- Invisible via Invisibility weave\n- Around a corner with no line of sight to enemies\n- In deep shadows after successful Stealth check\n\n---",
