    "description": "For characters who worship a corrupted version of one of the Eight.\n\n**Examples:**\n- **Ja'Alkira Extremists** (Bellicose) - Believe only Alkira matters, rejecting the other seven. Mechanically identical to Alkira patron but with fanatical roleplay.\n- **Death Cult of Nevil** - Worship Nevil as god of murder and undeath rather than natural death. Same mechanics as Nevil patron but perverted purpose.\n- **Tyrant's Justice** - Athore worship twisted to oppression, cruelty, and tyranny rather than righteous justice.\n- **Dark Fortune** - Rudlu worship focused on cursing enemies and stealing luck rather than playful trickery.\n\n**Mechanical Framework:**\n- Choose one of the Eight as patron\n- Use normal Divine Gift mechanics for that deity\n- Flavor and roleplay reflect the corruption\n- GM may impose consequences for betraying the deity's true nature (loss of powers, divine retribution, etc.)\n\n---"
