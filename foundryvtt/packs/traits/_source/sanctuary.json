For 1 minute, any enemy who targets them with an attack or harmful weave must make [[/save type=will]] (Wisdom + Luck) opposed by your Wisdom + Positive Mastery. If you win (more successes), they must choose a different target or their action is wasted. If the protected creature attacks or harms anyone, the effect ends.
