    "description": "Mersagian populace vary in appearance with the Northerners being quite pale and with all shades of hair and eye color. The Central and southern Meresaw populace tends to be olive skinned with darker hair and eyes. Mersagian names follow traditional English and American styles, but fantasy derived names are acceptable. It is quite possible to have a name from any of the other regions as the kingdom of Meresaw is very cosmopolitan."
