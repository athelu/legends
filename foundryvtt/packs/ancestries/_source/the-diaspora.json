    "description": "The actions of King Derhagar so enraged the Dwarven patron deity Athore, that he felt he had no recourse but to punish dwarvenkind. His will became manifest on Athelu as he ground the fine dwarven cities into the ground. Some were uplifted entirely and cast aside, others swallowed by the earth and others just ceased to exist. No dwarf was left to walk the world when his judgement was through. Athore could not destroy the Runic artifacts, but he could remove the knowledge of their creation. No dwarf would ever know of the power of this magic, nor be able to see it, or the effects of it even if present. \nThe many realms of the dwarves were isolated and trapped. Some pushed mile beneath the surface of Athelu as others were cast out of the prime material into other worlds and planes. These pockets of dwarves had yet to understand the depth of their punishment. Through Athore's judgment, each dwarf that survived his fury was cursed to live a half-life. No longer would they be able to create - with their access to the resources around them taken from them, - they would be forced to endure their isolation forever. They would no longer want for breath, food, or sleep. They would no longer feel the joy and rest that exhaustion could bring. Their sense of honor rekindled dwarves would value life especially when they were now denied it. Unable to end their own existence, the last dwarves are doomed forever to live in this misery."
