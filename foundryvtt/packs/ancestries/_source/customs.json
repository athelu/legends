    "description": "Dwarven armor and weapons are considered personal items.  Another dwarf would never handle another dwarf's weapons or armor. A dwarf customizes and maintains their armor and weapons throughout life. The identity of a dwarf lies in their armor and weapons as much as in their face or voice. The armor and weapons of great dwarven leaders is often put on display. Each hold's throne room is lined with this visage of leaders of the past. Hold's are identifiable through the decoration and style of their weapons and armor."
