(up to 12 creatures) <strong>Duration:</strong> 24 hours (or until completed) <strong>Total Cost:</strong> 13 Energy <strong>Action:</strong> Complex weave (2 actions) <strong>Weaving Roll:</strong> Negative Potential + Negative Mastery / Space Potential + Space Mastery / Time Potential + Time Mastery <strong>Effect:</strong> Up to 12 creatures you can see at medium range make Will saves. Compare your weaving successes to each target's save successes. Those you beat follow your suggested course of activity (1-2 sentences) that sounds reasonable. Targets pursue activity for 24 hours or until completing it. Obviously harmful suggestions end weave for that target. Creatures immune to charm are immune. <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will (to resist mental compulsion) <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = no effect (per target), 1 = 1 hour, 2 = 24 hours, 3 = 10 days, 4 = 30 days (extremely powerful compulsion)</p>\n<p>---</p>"
