Compare your weaving successes to each target's save successes. Based on net successes: 1 = Frightened, 2 = Fleeing, 3+ = Cowering. Creatures can make saves at end of turn to downgrade/end (1 success downgrades or ends). <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will (to resist fear) <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = no effect, 1 = Frightened (1 round), 2 = Fleeing (1 minute), 3 = Cowering, 4 = Paralyzed with fear (10 minutes) <strong>Frightened/Fleeing/Cowering Conditions:</strong> See conditions document for full mechanics.</p>"
