(10-foot cube) <strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute <strong>Total Cost:</strong> 9 Energy <strong>Action:</strong> Complex weave (2 actions) <strong>Weaving Roll:</strong> Space Potential + Space Mastery / Time Potential + Time Mastery <strong>Effect:</strong> Create an illusory effect at medium range in one creature's mind. Target makes [[/save type=will]]. Compare your weaving successes to their save successes. If you have more, target perceives illusory effect as real and rationalizes illogical elements. If illusory effect could damage target, it takes [[/damage 1d8 type=psychic]] damage per round. Target can use action + Perception vs your Space Mastery to recognize illusory effect. <strong>Applies Effects:</strong> disoriented <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will (to resist mental illusory effect); Perception vs Space Mastery (to disbelieve) <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 round, 2 = full effect ([[/damage 2d8]] damage), 3 = harder to disbelieve (add 1 to their Perception dice), 4 = 10 minutes or [[/damage 3d8]] damage, 5 = 1 hour + [[/damage 4d8]] damage <strong>Disoriented Condition (at Net 3):</strong> Target has Misfortune on Perception checks while illusory effect persists.</p>"
