Compare your weaving successes to each target's save successes. Those you beat have only 2 actions per turn (instead of 3), Misfortune on Agility checks and Reflex saves, and Misfortune on attacks. Targets can repeat save at end of each turn (1 success ends effect). <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will (to resist temporal slowdown) <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 round, 2 = full effect, 3 = 10 minutes, 4 = 6 targets or only 1 action per turn</p>\n<p>---</p>"
