    "description": "**Primary Energy:** Time 4 (decelerating personal time)  \n**Supporting Energy:** Space 4 (medium range + 4 targets)  \n**Range:** Medium, 60 ft. (up to 4 targets)  \n**Duration:** 1 minute (until save succeeds)  \n**Total Cost:** 8 Energy  \n**Action:** Complex weave (2 actions)  \n**Weaving Roll:** Time Potential + Time Mastery / Space Potential + Space Mastery  \n**Effect:** Up to 4 targets make Will saves. Compare your weaving successes to each target's save successes. Those you beat have only 2 actions per turn (instead of 3), Misfortune on Agility checks and Reflex saves, and Misfortune on attacks. Targets can repeat save at end of each turn (1 success ends effect).  \n**Saving Throw:** Will (to resist temporal slowdown)  \n**Success Scaling:** 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 round, 2 = full effect, 3 = 10 minutes, 4 = 6 targets or only 1 action per turn\n\n---"
