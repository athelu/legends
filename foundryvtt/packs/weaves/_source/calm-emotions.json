Compare your weaving successes to each target's save successes. Those you beat can choose to be affected (suppressing Charmed or Frightened) or you can suppress hostility (they become indifferent if not directly threatened). Creatures immune to charm are immune to this weave. <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 round, 2 = full effect (1 minute), 3 = 10 minutes, 4 = 1 hour, 5 = 4 hours</p>"
