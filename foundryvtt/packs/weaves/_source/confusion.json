Compare your weaving successes to each target's save successes. Those you beat are confused. At the start of each confused creature's turn, roll 1d8: 1-2 = do nothing, 3-4 = no action and move random direction, 5-6 = attack nearest creature, 7-8 = act normally. Can repeat save at end of each turn (1 success ends effect). <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 round, 2 = full effect, 3 = 20-foot radius, 4 = 10 minutes duration, 5 = 1 hour duration + 30-foot radius <strong>Note:</strong> Creatures immune to charm are immune to this weave</p>"
