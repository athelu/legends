Can repeat save at end of each turn (with Fortune if they took damage since last turn, 1 success ends effect).  \n**Saving Throw:** Will (to resist mental effect)  \n**Success Scaling:** 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 round, 2 = full effect, 3 = no save if damaged, 4 = 10 minutes  \n**Incapacitated Condition (at Net 2+):** Target can't take actions or reactions, is Prone, and can't stand.
