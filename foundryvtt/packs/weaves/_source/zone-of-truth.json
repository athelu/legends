All creatures in area make Will saves. Compare your weaving successes to each target's save successes. Those you beat can't speak deliberate lies while in the zone. They can be evasive, remain silent, or speak misleading truths. You know which creatures failed their saves. Creatures immune to charm are immune. <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will (to resist compulsion to speak truth) <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 minute, 2 = full effect, 3 = 1 hour, 4 = 20-foot radius</p>"
