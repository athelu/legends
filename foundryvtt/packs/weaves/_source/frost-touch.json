Target takes [[/damage 4 type=cold]] damage. This is an attack weave—no saving throw allowed. <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None (attack weave, weaving successes determine hit quality) <strong>Damage Type:</strong> Cold (energy) <strong>DR Interaction:</strong> Half DR ([[/damage 4 type=cold]] damage vs DR 4 becomes 4 - 2 = [[/damage 2]] damage) <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = miss, 1 = half damage (2), 2 = full damage (4), 3 = +[[/damage 4]] damage (8 total), 4 = +[[/damage 8]] damage (12 total) <strong>Slowed Condition (at 4 successes):</strong> Target's movement is halved until end of their next turn as ice crystals form on their body. <strong>Tactical Note:</strong> Does NOT provoke opportunity attacks. Touch range requires being adjacent to target.</p>\n<h2>G</h2>"
