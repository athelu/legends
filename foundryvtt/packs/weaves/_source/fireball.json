All creatures in a 20-foot radius sphere take [[/damage 28 type=fire]] damage. Each target takes the full listed damage and makes their own save. <strong>Applies Effects:</strong> ignited <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Reflex (to reduce damage) <strong>Damage Type:</strong> Fire (energy) <strong>DR Interaction:</strong> Half DR ([[/damage 28 type=fire]] damage vs DR 4 becomes 28 - 2 = [[/damage 26]] damage) <strong>Area Effect Note:</strong> With Space 4, this affects all creatures in a 20ft radius (approximately 4-6 targets in typical combat). Each target is resolved individually—some may take full damage while others dodge for reduced or no damage. <strong>Success Scaling (Net successes = Your successes - Their successes):</strong> 0 = no damage, 1 = half damage (14), 2 = full damage (28), 3 = +[[/damage 8]] damage (36 total), 4 = +[[/damage 16]] damage (44 total), 5 = +[[/damage 24]] damage (52 total) + applies Stunned <strong>Ignited Condition (at Net 4):</strong> Target takes [[/damage 1d8 type=fire]] damage at start of each turn.
