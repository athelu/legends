All creatures in area make Will saves. Compare your weaving successes to each target's save successes. Those you beat become Charmed and Incapacitated, staring at the pattern. Weave ends for a creature if it takes damage or if someone uses action to shake them (1 success ends effect). Creatures immune to charm are immune. <strong>Applies Effects:</strong> Incapacitated <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 round, 2 = full effect, 3 = 10 minutes, 4 = 10 minutes - 40-foot cube, 5 = 10 minutes - 40-foot cube</p>"
