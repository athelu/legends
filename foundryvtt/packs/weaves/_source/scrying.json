Target makes [[/save type=will]] (apply Fortune/Misfortune based on familiarity). Compare your weaving successes to their save successes. If you have more, you can see and hear through sensor. Target has vague feeling of being watched. <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will (to resist scrying, modified by familiarity) <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 minute, 2 = full effect, 3 = 1 hour, 4 = target doesn't sense you (8 hours)</p>\n<p>---</p>"
