    "description": "**Primary Energy:** Negative 4 (planting compulsion in mind)  \n**Supporting Energy:** Space 2 (medium range) / Time 3 (duration up to 8 hours)  \n**Range:** Medium, 60 ft.  \n**Duration:** 8 hours (or until completed)  \n**Total Cost:** 9 Energy  \n**Action:** Complex weave (2 actions)  \n**Weaving Roll:** Negative Potential + Negative Mastery / Space Potential + Space Mastery / Time Potential + Time Mastery  \n**Effect:** Target at medium range makes Will save. Compare your weaving successes to their save successes. If you have more, you suggest a course of activity (1-2 sentences) that sounds reasonable. Target pursues the activity for the duration or until completing it. Obviously harmful suggestions end the weave. Creatures immune to charm are immune.  \n**Saving Throw:** Will (to resist mental compulsion)  \n**Success Scaling:** 0 = no effect, 1 = 1 hour, 2 = full effect (8 hours), 3 = 24 hours, 4 = very hard to resist (they need Fortune on future saves if conditions change)  \n\n---"
