    "description": "**Primary Energy:** Space 4 (disrupting magical energy)\n**Supporting Energy:** None (medium range 60ft, reaction)\n**Total Cost:** 4 Energy base (must match or exceed target weave cost)\n**Action:** Reaction (when you see a weave being cast)\n**Weaving Roll:** Space Potential + Space Mastery (2d8 only)\n**Effect:** Attempt to interrupt a weave being cast. Must spend Energy equal to or greater than the weave you're countering. Compare your weaving successes to their weaving successes. If you have more, their weave fails.\n**Saving Throw:** Opposed weaving check (Your Space weaving vs Their weaving)\n**Success Scaling (Net successes = Your successes - Their successes):** 1+ = Counter successful (weave fails)"
