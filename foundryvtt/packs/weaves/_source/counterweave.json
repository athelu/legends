Must spend Energy equal to or greater than the weave you're countering. Compare your weaving successes to their weaving successes. If you have more, their weave fails. <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Opposed weaving check (Your Space weaving vs Their weaving) <strong>Success Scaling (Net successes = Your successes - Their successes):</strong> 1+ = Counter successful (weave fails)</p>"
