Compare your weaving successes to their save successes. If you have more, extraplanar creatures are sent to their home plane. Native creatures are sent to a harmless demiplane. Target reappears when weave ends.\n**Saving Throw:** Will (to resist planar banishment)\n**Success Scaling (Net successes = Your successes - Their successes):** 1 = 1 round, 2 = full effect, 3 = 10 minutes, 4 = 1 hour"
