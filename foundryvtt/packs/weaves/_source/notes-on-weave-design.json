      "value": "<p>Energy costs can be adjusted by weavers (spend more for more damage, larger area, etc.) Success scaling shows what happens at different weaving success levels Complex weaves (2 actions) are typically save-based or have area effects Simple weaves (1 action) are typically direct effects or touch range Weavers can combine energies creatively Increase Damage: Spend 2 more Energy per damage tier (8/16/24/32) Increase Range: +1 Energy per range increment (Touch/Close/Medium/Long) Increase Area: +1 Energy per area increase (single, 2 targets/10ft. 4 targets/20ft, 6 targets/30ft) Increase Duration: +1 Energy per duration step (instant/1 round/1minute/10 minutes/1 hour) Overspending Penalty Remember: Spending Energy beyond your Mastery in that energy type adds +1 to both dice per point over. Plan your weaves within your capabilities or accept the penalty for heroic moments! These weaves are guidelines. Work with your GM to create unique effects by combining energies in new ways. The eight energies are tools</p>\n<p><!-- PACK:weaves --></p>\n<h2>A</h2>"
