    "description": "Energy costs can be adjusted by weavers (spend more for more damage, larger area, etc.)\nSuccess scaling shows what happens at different weaving success levels\nComplex weaves (2 actions) are typically save-based or have area effects\nSimple weaves (1 action) are typically direct effects or touch range\nWeavers can combine energies creatively\nIncrease Damage: Spend 2 more Energy per damage tier (8/16/24/32)\nIncrease Range: +1 Energy per range increment (Touch/Close/Medium/Long)\nIncrease Area: +1 Energy per area increase (single, 2 targets/10ft. 4 targets/20ft, 6 targets/30ft)\nIncrease Duration: +1 Energy per duration step (instant/1 round/1minute/10 minutes/1 hour)\nOverspending Penalty Remember: Spending Energy beyond your Mastery in that energy type adds +1 to both dice per point over. Plan your weaves within your capabilities or accept the penalty for heroic moments!\nThese weaves are guidelines. Work with your GM to create unique effects by combining energies in new ways. The eight energies are tools\n\n## A"
