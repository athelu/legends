You have Fortune on Stealth checks and observers have Misfortune on Perception checks to detect your true location. Can use action to move the double up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave however you wish. <strong>Applies Effects:</strong> hidden <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Perception vs Space Mastery (to recognize double as illusory effect) <strong>Success Scaling:</strong> 0 = fails, 1 = 1 minute, 2 = full effect, 3 = 1 hour, 4 = 8 hours</p>"
