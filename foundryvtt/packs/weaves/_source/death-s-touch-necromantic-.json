    "description": "**Primary Energy:** Negative 8 (pure death energy combined with soul binding)\n**Supporting Energy:** Space 2 (medium range 60ft)\n**Total Cost:** 10 Energy\n**Action:** Complex weave (2 actions)\n**Weaving Roll:** Negative Potential + Negative Mastery + Space Potential + Space Mastery (4d8)\n**Effect:** Target takes 40 negative damage. Target makes Fortitude save to reduce. If reduced to 0 HP by this weave, target dies and rises as a zombie under your control after 1 minute.\n**Saving Throw:** Fortitude (to resist death energy)\n**Damage Type:** Negative (energy)\n**DR Interaction:** Half DR (40 negative damage vs DR 4 becomes 40 - 2 = 38 damage)\n**Success Scaling (Net successes = Your successes - Their successes):** 0 = no damage, 1 = 1/2 damage (20), 2 = full damage (40), 3 = +8 damage (48 total), 4 = +16 damage (56 total, instant death if reduced to -Constitution)\n**Necromantic Warning:** The soul-binding component of this weave (raising the slain as undead) represents lost First Men knowledge. Cannot be learned at character creation, requires GM permission. The damage portion is standard Negative energy, but the automatic raising effect manipulates pneuma."
