It does not bypass the need to make weaving checks.\n**Benefit:** When you take a [Combat] action with a melee weapon, can cast one Simple Weave (2 Energy cost or less) as part of the same action. You still make the normal weaving check for the weave (Potential + Mastery for each energy used). Both the attack and the weave use the same [Combat] action\n**Usage:** Passive\n**Keyword:** [Combat], [Magic]"
