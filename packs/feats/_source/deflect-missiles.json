Most people assumed that was metaphor. You've managed it, though catching them is still more impressive when you're not desperately trying to avoid being shot.\n**Benefit:** When hit by a ranged weapon attack, you may use a [Reaction] to reduce damage by 1d8 + Dex + Wis. If you reduce damage to 0, you can catch the projectile. If you catch it, you can spend 1 Luck to make a ranged attack with it as part of same reaction (range 20/60 ft)\n**Usage:** Reaction (catching and throwing costs Luck)\n**Keyword:** [Combat], [Ascetic], [Reaction]"
