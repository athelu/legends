### Sensory Conditions

-   Your attacks have Misfortune

### Stealth & Visibility Conditions

#### Concealed
- Your location is known, but you are difficult to see clearly
- Attackers can target you but with penalties
- **Attack Penalties:** Attackers add 1 to both dice when attacking you
- **Perception Penalties:** Others add 1 to both dice when using perception checks to see details about you

**Common Sources:**
- Fog, mist, smoke
- Heavy rain or snow
- Dim light or shadows (not total darkness)
- Dense foliage or undergrowth
- Obscuring magical effects
- Environmental conditions (sandstorm, etc.)

**Does NOT Prevent Targeting:**
- You can still be directly targeted by attacks and weaves
- Enemies know which square you occupy
- Different from Hidden (where location is unknown)

**Stacking with Cover:**
- Concealment and Cover can stack
- Example: Behind low wall in fog = Partial Cover + Concealed 

**Duration:** 
- Lasts as long as environmental condition persists
- Moving into clear conditions ends Concealment
- Bright light or magical effects (like Revealing Light) may end Concealment

**Recovery:**
- Automatically ends when you move into clear, well-lit conditions
- Some weaves (like Radiant Sphere, Revealing Light) automatically end Concealment
- Revealed condition prevents gaining Concealment

---

#### Hidden
- Your location is unknown; enemies do not know which square you occupy
- Enemies cannot directly target you with attacks or single-target weaves
- You have significant tactical advantage

**How to Gain Hidden:**

1. **Successful Stealth Check:**
   - Use Hide action (normally 1 [Combat] action, or 1 [Minor] with Swift Movement feat)
   - Make Stealth check opposed by observers' Perception
   - Must have something to hide behind (cover, concealment, etc.)
   - Success: You gain Hidden condition
   - Failure: Observers know your location (you may be Concealed but not Hidden)

2. **Invisibility:**
   - Invisibility weaves grant Hidden condition
   - Observers cannot see you without magical means
   - Can still be detected by sound, smell, touch, or environmental clues

3. **Full Cover from All Observers:**
   - If no enemy has line of sight to you, and you pass a stealth check you are Hidden from them
   - Example: Behind a wall, around a corner, inside a closed room

4. **Magical Effects:**
   - Some weaves or abilities grant Hidden condition
   - Darkness that prevents vision

**Cannot Be Directly Targeted:**
- Enemies cannot make attack rolls against you (don't know where you are)
- Single-target weaves requiring line of sight cannot target you
- Area effects can still affect you if your general area is targeted

**Attacking While Hidden:**
- You have Fortune on your first attack roll while Hidden
- Making an attack typically reveals your position:
  - **Standard:** Attack reveals you, you become visible
  - **Exception:** Woodcraft feat - ranged attacks from hiding in natural terrain don't automatically reveal position (enemies must succeed Perception check)
  - **Exception:** Perfect Invisibility - doesn't break when attacking

**Detection:**
If an observer succeeds on Perception check to detect you:
- **Hidden → Visible** 

**Ways to Detect Hidden Creatures:**

1. **Active Search [Interact action]:**
   - Make Perception check opposed by Hidden creature's Stealth
   - Success: Creature loses Hidden, becomes Visible
   - Failure: Creature remains Hidden

2. **Passive Perception:**
   - GM compares observer's Passive Perception to Hidden creature's Stealth result
   - If Passive Perception equals or beats Stealth, creature is detected

3. **Non-Visual Detection:**
   - **Sound:** Footsteps, breathing, knocked objects, armor noise (Perception check)
   - **Smell:** Strong scents, perfume, unwashed (Perception check, often with Misfortune)
   - **Touch:** Bumping into invisible creature (automatic detection → Concealed)
   - **Environmental:** Footprints in snow, ripples in water, disturbed fog, moving grass (Investigation or Perception check)
   - **Magical:** Perfect Sight, tremorsense, blindsight, other special senses

**Maintaining Hidden:**
- Requires continued stealth
- GM may call for new Stealth checks if you move (especially if moving quickly or across noisy terrain)
- Broken if enemies successfully detect you
- Automatically broken by Revealed condition
- Broken by most offensive actions (attacks, casting obvious weaves)

**Special Senses:**
- Creatures with Blindsight can detect Hidden creatures within range reducing their benefit to concealed.
- Creatures with Tremorsense detect Hidden creatures on the ground reducing their benefit to concealed.
- Perfect Sight sees through invisibility and illusory effects

**Area of Effect Targeting:**
- Enemies can target your general area with AOE weaves
- Example: "I cast Fireball centered on that cluster of barrels where I heard noise"
- You're still affected if you're in the area, even though they can't target you directly

**Duration:** 
- Until revealed, you attack, or conditions change
- Revealed condition immediately ends Hidden

**Example Situations:**
- Successfully hiding behind a pillar during combat
- Invisible via Invisibility weave
- Around a corner with no line of sight to enemies
- In deep shadows after successful Stealth check

---

#### Revealed
- Magic or effects expose your true position and prevent concealment
- You cannot hide or benefit from obscuring effects
- Typically caused by radiant magic or detection weaves

**Effects:**
- You immediately lose Hidden condition (if you had it)
- You immediately lose Concealed condition (if you had it)
- You **cannot gain** Hidden or Concealed conditions while Revealed
- Invisibility is suppressed (you become visible)
- Magical darkness concealing you is dispelled or rendered ineffective
- Often accompanied by visible effect (glowing outline, radiant aura, etc.)

**Common Sources:**
- **Holy Fire** (4 successes): Target receives Revealed condition until end of target's next turn
- **Radiant Touch** (4 successes): Target glows with radiant energy, becomes visible until end of their next turn
- **Revealing Light** weave: Outlines creatures in violet light, prevents invisibility
- Minor Positive Energy condition effect (magic system)

**Duration:** 
- Typically until end of target's next turn (most common)
- Some effects specify different durations
- Each effect specifies its own duration in the weave/ability description

**Cannot Be Ended Early:**
- No saving throw to end early (unless specified by effect)
- Cannot be removed by mundane means
- Magical dispelling (Unweave) can remove magical Revealed effects
- Automatically ends after specified duration

**Interaction with Other Conditions:**
- **Overrides:** Concealed and Hidden (removes them)
- **Prevents:** Gaining new Concealed or Hidden conditions
- **Does NOT prevent:** Physical cover from walls, barriers, etc.
- **Physical cover still functions:** Being Revealed doesn't negate cover from a wall or shield

**Does NOT Affect:**
- Physical cover (walls, doors, shields still provide cover)
- Damage Resistance or DR
- Other defensive abilities unrelated to visibility

**Example Situations:**
- Struck by Holy Fire at 4 successes, you glow with radiant energy
- Outlined by Revealing Light, glowing with violet radiance
- Hit by Radiant Touch, shining brightly and exposing you even in magical darkness

**Recovery:**
- Automatically ends after specified duration
- Cannot be ended early except by magical dispelling (if from magical source)
- Effect ends, you can attempt to hide/gain concealment again normally
- New Revealed effects can extend duration (apply whichever has longer remaining duration)

### Mental & Social Conditions

- You cannot attack the charmer or target them with harmful abilities/weaves
- You can still act freely otherwise and defend yourself
- You interpret the charmer's words and actions in the most favorable way possible

- **Recovery:** 
  - Condition ends immediately if charmer or their allies harm you
  - Some charm effects allow Will save at end of each turn to end early
  - Effect ends when duration expires
- **Note:** You're friendly and suggestible, not dominated. You won't follow commands that are obviously harmful to yourself or that go against your core values. The charmer must still convince you through normal social interaction, they just have an easier time doing so.

**Example:** A charmed guard won't attack their charmer, and might be convinced to let them pass with a good story. But they won't hand over the keys to the treasury or betray their lord without exceptional persuasion - being charmed makes you friendly, not stupid.
