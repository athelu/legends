# Feats

## Feat System Overview
Feats are the primary way characters gain special abilities, combat techniques, and class-like features. Unlike the old system where traits gated access to abilities, feats are now available to any character who meets the prerequisites.

### Feat Costs and Limits
-   **Cost:** 40 XP per feat
-   **Starting Feats:** Every character receives 2 free feats at creation
-   **Tier Limits:** Can purchase up to 2 feats per tier (starting feats don't count)
-   **Total by Tier 8:** 2 starting + 16 purchased = 18 feats maximum

### Prerequisites
Most feats require:
-   Minimum attribute (typically 3-5)
-   Minimum skill rank (typically 3-5)
-   Sometimes: Previous feat, tier requirement, or story requirement


## FEAT BUILDING GUIDE FOR GMs

When creating new feats, follow these guidelines:

### Prerequisites
- **Low power (basic):** Attribute 3-4, Skill 3
- **Medium power:** Attribute 5, Skill 4
- **High power:** Attribute 6+, Skill 5+
- **Capstone:** Tier 5+, Attribute 7+, Skill 6+

### Power Levels
- **Basic feat:** Single +1-2 bonus or minor ability
- **Standard feat:** Core class feature, reliable combat ability
- **Advanced feat:** Requires previous feat, significant power boost
- **Capstone feat:** Tier 5+, game-changing ability

### Balance Checks
- Does it overshadow multiple feats combined?
- Does it trivialize challenges?
- Does it require meaningful choice/tradeoff?
- Could multiple characters benefit, or is it too niche?

### Usage Limits
- **Unlimited:** Passive bonuses, always-on abilities
- **Once per turn:** Action economy limit
- **Once per round:** Reaction-based
- **Once per short rest:** Powerful but recoverable
- **Once per session:** Extremely powerful
- **Once per day/week:** Campaign-defining

  - Air: Fly speed equal to walking, can't be grappled
  - Earth: Burrow speed 10 feet, tremorsense 30 feet
- **Elemental Strikes:** All unarmed strikes automatically deal +3d8 elemental damage (no Energy cost, no weaving check)

**Limitations:** Cannot cast weaves while transformed (all pneuma dedicated to maintaining form). Dropping to 0 HP ends transformation immediately.

**Description:** You've achieved what few martial artists ever dream of—complete unity with an element. You don't channel fire, you ARE fire. You don't manipulate water, you BECOME water. The distinction between your pneuma and elemental energy dissolves entirely.

### Integration Feats (Tier 3+)

#### Elemental Rapid Strikes (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Rapid Strikes feat, Pneuma Strike (any element), Tier 3+

**Benefit:** You can channel elemental energy through your Rapid Strikes flurry. When using Rapid Strikes (3 attacks in one action):

- Choose to spend 4 Energy total (instead of 2 per strike)
- Make ONE weaving check for your chosen element
- Apply the weaving result to ALL THREE strikes
- **1 success:** Each hit deals +1d8 elemental damage
- **2 successes:** Each hit deals +2d8 elemental damage

**Efficiency:** This is more Energy-efficient than using Pneuma Strike three separate times (4 Energy vs 6 Energy), but risks all-or-nothing on single weaving check.

**Description:** Your flurry becomes a blur of elemental fury. Fire, ice, lightning, or stone—the energy flows through every strike like a continuous stream rather than separate bursts.

#### Stunning Element Strike (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Stunning Strike feat, Pneuma Strike (any element), Tier 3+

**Benefit:** When you successfully Stun an opponent with Stunning Strike, you can spend an additional 2 Energy to infuse them with elemental energy:

- Choose one element you have Pneuma Strike for
- Target immediately takes 2d8 elemental damage (no weaving check, ignores DR)
- Energy courses through their paralyzed form
- **If Stunned condition ends early:** Target takes additional 1d8 elemental damage as residual energy releases

**Description:** You don't just interrupt their pneuma flow—you flood it with elemental energy. The shock of foreign pneuma coursing through their meridians is devastating.
