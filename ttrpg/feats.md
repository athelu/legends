# Feats

## Feat System Overview
Feats are the primary way characters gain special abilities, combat techniques, and class-like features. Unlike the old system where traits gated access to abilities, feats are now available to any character who meets the prerequisites.

### Feat Costs and Limits
-   **Cost:** 40 XP per feat
-   **Starting Feats:** Every character receives 2 free feats at creation
-   **Tier Limits:** Can purchase up to 2 feats per tier (starting feats don't count)
-   **Total by Tier 8:** 2 starting + 16 purchased = 18 feats maximum

## FEAT BUILDING GUIDE FOR GMs

When creating new feats, follow these guidelines:

### Prerequisites (Updated)
- **Tier 1 feats:** Attribute 3, Skill 3
- **Tier 2 feats:** Attribute 4, Skill 4
- **Tier 3 feats:** Attribute 5, Skill 5
- **Tier 4 feats:** Attribute 5-6, Skill 5-6

### Power Levels
- **Basic feat:** Single +1-2 bonus or minor ability
- **Standard feat:** Core class feature, reliable combat ability
- **Advanced feat:** Requires previous feat, significant power boost
- **Capstone feat:** Tier 5+, game-changing ability

### Balance Checks
- Does it overshadow multiple feats combined?
- Does it trivialize challenges?
- Does it require meaningful choice/tradeoff?
- Could multiple characters benefit, or is it too niche?

### Usage Limits
- **Unlimited:** Passive bonuses, always-on abilities
- **Once per turn:** Action economy limit
- **Once per round:** Reaction-based
- **Once per short rest:** Powerful but recoverable
- **Once per session:** Extremely powerful
