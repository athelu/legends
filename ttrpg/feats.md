# D8 TTRPG - Part 5: Feats

## Feat System Overview

Feats are the primary way characters gain special abilities, combat techniques, and class-like features. Unlike the old system where traits gated access to abilities, feats are now available to any character who meets the prerequisites.

### Feat Costs and Limits
-   **Cost:** 40 XP per feat
-   **Starting Feats:** Every character receives 2 free feats at creation
-   **Tier Limits:** Can purchase up to 2 feats per tier (starting feats don't count)
-   **Total by Tier 8:** 2 starting + 16 purchased = 18 feats maximum

### Prerequisites
Most feats require:
-   Minimum attribute (typically 3-5)
-   Minimum skill rank (typically 3-5)
-   Sometimes: Previous feat, tier requirement, or story requirement
