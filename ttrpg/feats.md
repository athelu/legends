# D8 TTRPG - Part 5: Feats

## Feat System Overview

Feats are the primary way characters gain special abilities, combat techniques, and class-like features. Unlike the old system where traits gated access to abilities, feats are now available to any character who meets the prerequisites.

### Feat Costs and Limits
-   **Cost:** 40 XP per feat
-   **Starting Feats:** Every character receives 2 free feats at creation
-   **Tier Limits:** Can purchase up to 2 feats per tier (starting feats don't count)
-   **Total by Tier 8:** 2 starting + 16 purchased = 18 feats maximum

### Prerequisites
Most feats require:
-   Minimum attribute (typically 3-5)
-   Minimum skill rank (typically 3-5)
-   Sometimes: Previous feat, tier requirement, or story requirement


## FEAT BUILDING GUIDE FOR GMs

When creating new feats, follow these guidelines:

### Prerequisites
- **Low power (basic):** Attribute 3-4, Skill 3
- **Medium power:** Attribute 5, Skill 4
- **High power:** Attribute 6+, Skill 5+
- **Capstone:** Tier 5+, Attribute 7+, Skill 6+

### Power Levels
- **Basic feat:** Single +1-2 bonus or minor ability
- **Standard feat:** Core class feature, reliable combat ability
- **Advanced feat:** Requires previous feat, significant power boost
- **Capstone feat:** Tier 5+, game-changing ability

### Balance Checks
- Does it overshadow multiple feats combined?
- Does it trivialize challenges?
- Does it require meaningful choice/tradeoff?
- Could multiple characters benefit, or is it too niche?

### Usage Limits
- **Unlimited:** Passive bonuses, always-on abilities
- **Once per turn:** Action economy limit
- **Once per round:** Reaction-based
- **Once per short rest:** Powerful but recoverable
- **Once per session:** Extremely powerful
- **Once per day/week:** Campaign-defining

---

---

### Arcanist Feats

#### Detect Magic (At-Will) (Tier 1+)
**Prerequisites:** Arcane 3, any magical tradition trait

**Benefit:** Can sense magical auras as [Minor] action without spending Energy.

Does not reveal specific spell effects.

#### Ward Analysis (Tier 2+)
**Prerequisites:** Arcane 4, Space Mastery 2 or Time Mastery 2

**Benefit:** Can analyze magical wards and barriers.

---

## BATTLE MAGE FEATS

### Weapon Weaver (Tier 1+)
**Prerequisites:** Melee Combat 3, any magical tradition trait

**Benefit:** When you take an Attack action with a melee weapon, can cast one Simple Weave (2 Energy cost or less) as part of the same action. You still make the normal weaving check for the weave (Potential + Mastery for each energy used). Both the attack and the weave use the same [Combat] action, and you apply the Multiple Action Penalty if you're making additional attacks this turn.

**Example:** You can swing your sword (make Melee Combat check) and cast *Shocking Grasp* (make Air weaving check) as a single [Combat] action. If this is your second [Combat] action this turn, add 1 to all dice for both the attack check and the weaving check.

**Note:** This feat allows you to combine a weapon attack and a Simple Weave into one action—it does not bypass the need to make weaving checks.

### Battle Casting (Tier 2+)
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Weaver, any magical tradition trait, Tier 2+

**Benefit:** Can cast Simple Weaves (2 Energy cost or less) as a [Minor] action instead of a full action. You still make the normal weaving check (Potential + Mastery for each energy used). This allows you to cast a Simple Weave and make weapon attacks in the same turn without combining them into a single action.

**Example:** Use [Minor] action to cast *Shield* (make Space weaving check as normal), then use [Combat] action to attack twice with your sword.

**Note:** Complex weaves (3+ Energy cost) still require a full action or multiple actions. All weaving checks are still required—this feat only changes the action economy, not the mechanics of weaving.

### Spellstrike (Tier 2+)
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Weaver, any magical tradition trait, Tier 2+

**Benefit:** When you hit with a melee weapon attack, can immediately make a Simple Weave (2 Energy) using one elemental energy to channel power through your weapon strike. Make a weaving check using the chosen energy's Potential + Mastery (2d8):

- **1 success:** +1d8 elemental damage
- **2 successes:** +2d8 elemental damage

Choose damage type from: Fire, Cold, Lightning, or Acid (based on Fire, Water, Air, or Earth energy used). The weaving check uses the same action as your attack (both are part of the same [Combat] action).

**Target's Defense:** Target uses their DR against the elemental damage as normal. If they have Resistance to the damage type, they gain +1 DR against it.

**Example:** A battle mage with Fire Potential 5, Fire Mastery 4 hits with their longsword for 6 damage. They spend 2 Energy and roll Fire weaving check (2d8, looking for results under 5 and 4). Rolling 3 and 2 = 2 successes = +2d8 fire damage. Target has DR 3 and no fire resistance, so takes 6 physical damage - 3 DR = 3, plus 2d8 fire damage - 3 DR.

### Arcane Strike (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Weapon Weaver, Battle Casting, Melee Combat 5, Tier 3+

**Benefit:** You gain the Extra Attack ability when wielding a melee weapon. You can make 2 weapon attacks when you take the Attack action using one [Combat] action. Combined with Battle Casting, you can cast a Simple Weave as [Minor] action and then make 2 attacks as [Combat] action.

**Example Turn:** [Minor] cast *Blade Ward*, [Combat] attack twice with greatsword, [Move] reposition.

**Note:** This stacks with other sources of Extra Attack (such as from martial feats), but Multiple Action Penalty still applies if you take multiple [Combat] actions.

---

## ORGANIZATION FEATS

### CAMPAIGN NOTE: Organizational Training as Background

**For Investigation-Focused Campaigns:** If your GM is running a campaign where all PCs work for the same organization (Ministry of Mysteries, League of Antiquities, etc.), consider granting **Organizational Training** for free to all characters as a campaign assumption. This represents their baseline organizational membership and allows characters to spend their starting feats on personal specialization instead.

**Roleplaying Hook:** Your organization values results. How do they reward success? How do they react to failure?

### Deep Network (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Shadow Network feat, Organizational Training, Society 5, Tier 3+

**Benefit:** Your organization's resources dramatically expand your intelligence network. The number of informants you can maintain increases to (Int × 2). Additionally, you gain access to your organization's existing network:

- In any major settlement, can contact organization's local operatives within 1 hour
- Make Society check: 1 success = access to general intelligence about the area; 2 successes = access to specific, actionable intelligence or rumors
- Once per session, can request organization use its resources to investigate a specific question (answer provided within 1 day, GM discretion on information quality)

**Benefit:** You're trained in operational security and information compartmentalization. Gain the following benefits:

**Memory Partition:** Can voluntarily suppress specific memories (up to 24 hours of recent experiences). Suppressed memories cannot be extracted through interrogation, torture, or magic.

**Alchemical Bombs:**
- **Action:** Throw as [Combat] action (range 30 feet, targets point)

- **Damage:** 2d8 + Int modifier (choose Fire, Acid, Cold, or Lightning when creating)
- **Save:** Creatures in area make Reflex save vs your Int + chosen energy Mastery. Success = half damage
- **Duration:** Unstable. Lose potency after 24 hours

**Alchemical Potions:**

---

### Invoker Support Feats

#### Master of Names (Tier 2+)
**Prerequisites:** Invoker trait, Cha 5, Air Mastery 4

**Benefit:** You've learned additional true names, expanding your magical vocabulary. Gain access to one additional energy type beyond your original 5:
- Choose from: Earth, Fire, Water, or Negative (whichever you didn't already have)
- Roll 1d8 for that energy's Potential (cannot exceed 8)
- Gain the corresponding Mastery skill (starts at rank 0)
- Your Energy Pool increases by the new Potential value

**Restriction:** Can only take this feat once.

**Lore:** You've discovered a sixth true name through research, revelation, or desperate need. The word came to you in dreams, whispered by daemons, or revealed through study of ancient texts. Speaking it feels unnatural at first—the syllables don't quite fit your tongue—but with practice, the name responds to your will.

#### Resonant Voice (Tier 2+)
**Prerequisites:** Invoker trait, Words of Power ability, Cha 5, Air Mastery 4

**Benefit:** Your Words of Power ability gains additional functionality. When you use Words of Power:

**Empowerment (Allies):** As normal - all allies within 60 feet who can hear you subtract 1 from both dice on their next roll

**Dissonance (Enemies):** As bonus effect - all enemies within 30 feet who can hear you add 1 to both dice on their next roll (if they can hear)

**Usage:** Once per short rest (affects both allies and enemies simultaneously)

**Lore:** You've learned to modulate the resonance of true names, creating harmonics that bolster allies while creating discordant vibrations that unsettle foes. The same word carries dual meaning—a blessing to those who understand, a curse to those who oppose.

#### Silent Names (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Invoker trait, Cha 6, Air Mastery 5, Tier 3+

**Benefit:** You've mastered the art of subvocal invocation. You can speak true names without making audible sound:

**Silent Casting:**
- Your weaves have no verbal component
- Enemies cannot identify you as the caster through sound alone
- Weaves cannot be countered by Silence effects
- You can cast while gagged, underwater, or in vacuum

**Limitation:** Still requires line of sight to targets (Invoker requirement remains)

**Counterspell Resistance:** When enemy attempts to counter your weave, they add 2 to both dice (harder without hearing the invocation)

**Lore:** True names exist beyond sound—they are concepts given voice. You've learned to speak them directly to the pneuma, bypassing the need for physical vibration. The words resonate in the space between thoughts, heard by magic itself but not by mortal ears.

#### Name of Unmaking (Tier 4+)
**Prerequisites:** Invoker trait, Cha 7, Space Mastery 5, Tier 4+

**Benefit:** You know the true name of unraveling—a word that unmakes other magic. Gain counterspell ability:

**Counterspell (Invoker):**
- **Trigger:** Enemy casts weave you can see within 60 feet
- **Action:** [Reaction]
- **Cost:** No Energy required
- **Check:** Make opposed check: Your Cha + Space Mastery vs their weaving successes
- **Effect:** If you win, their weave fails (Energy still spent by them)
- **Usage:** Uses your Words of Power daily resource (once per short rest)

**Lore:** This is not a true name of creation like others you know—it's a name of ending. Speaking it feels wrong, like pronouncing a word backwards while time flows in reverse. The syllables seem to erase themselves from memory even as you speak them, unwriting reality where magic was woven.

---

**Prerequisites:** Fire Mastery 6, Fire Potential 6, any magical tradition trait, Tier 3+

**Thermal Vision:** You can see heat signatures in darkness or through light obscurement (smoke, fog). Range 60 feet.

**Lore:** Fire has become more than energy you channel—it's part of your pneuma. Flames bend to your will, recognizing you as kin. You feel their hunger, their rage, their cleansing fury.

#### Water Savant (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Water Mastery 6, Water Potential 6, any magical tradition trait, Tier 3+

**Benefit:** Your mastery of Water energy grants the following abilities:

**Freezing Weaves:** When you cast a weave using Water as primary energy and deal cold damage, targets that fail their save gain the **Major Slowed** condition (see Conditions document) until end of their next turn.

**Frost Resistance:** You are immune to cold damage from non-magical sources. You have Resistance (+2 DR) against magical cold damage.

**Aquatic Adaptation:** You can breathe underwater. Gain swimming speed equal to your normal movement speed. Water-based Wilderness checks gain Fortune.

**Lore:** Water flows through you as naturally as blood. You understand its paradox—fluid yet forceful, yielding yet unyielding. The ocean depths call to you, and ice forms at your command.

#### Air Savant (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Air Mastery 6, Air Potential 6, any magical tradition trait, Tier 3+

**Benefit:** Your mastery of Air energy grants the following abilities:

**Shocking Weaves:** When you cast a weave using Air as primary energy and deal lightning damage, targets that fail their save gain the **Stunned** condition (see Conditions document) until end of their next turn.

**Storm Resistance:** You are immune to lightning damage from non-magical sources. You have Resistance (+2 DR) against magical lightning damage.

**Windwalker:** You ignore movement penalties from difficult terrain. Can walk on water or other liquids as if solid ground. Falling damage reduced by half (cushioned by winds).

**Lore:** The winds answer your call. You hear their whispers, feel their currents, ride their invisible paths. The space between breaths holds power you can grasp and shape.

#### Earth Savant (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Earth Mastery 6, Earth Potential 6, any magical tradition trait, Tier 3+

**Benefit:** Your mastery of Earth energy grants the following abilities:

**Crushing Weaves:** When you cast a weave using Earth as primary energy and deal bludgeoning/piercing damage, targets that fail their save gain **Prone** and **Restrained** conditions (see Conditions document) until they use an action to break free (Might check, Hard task = 2 successes).

**Stone Resilience:** You have natural DR 2 that stacks with armor (not magical). Your HP calculation uses Con × 9 instead of Con × 8.

**Tremorsense:** You can sense vibrations through solid surfaces, detecting movement within 30 feet even if you cannot see. Ignore Blinded penalties when both you and target touch same surface.

**Lore:** Stone recognizes stone. Your bones have become denser, your flesh harder. The earth itself steadies your stance, and you feel the tremors of all who walk upon it.

#### Death Weaver (Tier 4+)
**Prerequisites:** Negative Mastery 7, Negative Potential 7, any magical tradition trait, Tier 4+

**Benefit:** Your mastery of Negative energy grants the following abilities:

**FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE WARNING:** This feat requires GM approval and represents mastery of forbidden arts. In most Legends campaigns, necromancy is lost First Men knowledge. Taking this feat implies your character has somehow recovered this forbidden lore.

**Draining Weaves:** When you cast a weave using Negative as primary energy and deal negative damage:
- You heal HP equal to half the negative damage dealt
- Targets that fail their save have Misfortune on their next attack roll (life force weakened)

**Undeath Affinity:** You have Resistance (+2 DR) against negative energy damage. Undead do not automatically attack you unless commanded to. You can communicate with undead (they understand you, though they may not obey).

**Corpse Sense:** You can sense the presence of corpses and undead within 60 feet. You can determine how long a corpse has been dead and whether it possessed pneuma.

**Lore:** You have gazed into the void beyond death and returned changed. Negative energy flows through you like blood, and the boundary between life and death has thinned. The dead recognize you as something close to kin—neither fully alive nor fully dead, but something in between.

---

## ELEMENTAL MARTIAL ARTS FEATS

### Foundation Feat

#### Pneuma Strike (Tier 1+)

- **2 successes:** +2d8 elemental damage
- **Damage type:** Fire/Cold/Lightning/Acid based on element chosen
  - Fire = Fire damage
  - Water = Cold damage
  - Air = Lightning damage
  - Earth = Acid damage

**Special:** This feat can be taken multiple times. Each time, choose a different elemental energy.

**Lore:** You've discovered how to let pneuma flow through your body, not just your mind. Where spellcasters weave energy at range, you channel it through flesh and bone, releasing it at the moment of impact. Your strikes crackle with elemental fury.

---

### Advanced Elemental Techniques (Tier 2+)

#### Elemental Burst (Tier 2+)
**Prerequisites:** Pneuma Strike, any elemental Mastery 4+, Tier 2+

  - 1 success (you win): 2d8 elemental damage  
  - 0 successes (tie/lose): 1d8 elemental damage
- **Damage type:** Based on energy (Fire/Cold/Lightning/Acid)

#### Elemental Reach (Tier 2+)
**Prerequisites:** Pneuma Strike, any elemental Mastery 4+, Tier 2+

**Benefit:** You can extend your strikes with elemental energy. Choose one elemental energy you have Pneuma Strike for. When using Pneuma Strike with that energy, you can spend 1 additional Energy (3 total) to:

**Visual by Element:**

**Benefit:** You channel water's adaptive nature through your defenses. While using Mystic Defense (unarmored):

- **Resistance:** Gain Resistance (+2 DR) against cold damage
- **Adaptive Guard:** Once per round as [Reaction], when hit by melee attack, you can spend 2 Energy to create a shield of flowing water. Make Water weaving check (Potential + Mastery):
  - 1+ successes: Reduce damage by your Wisdom score
  - 2 successes: Reduce damage by your Wisdom score × 2

**Lore:** Water adapts to any container, any pressure. Your defense flows like a river, yielding to absorb impacts and redirecting force harmlessly away.

- **Heat Vision:** You can see heat signatures in darkness (as per Fire Savant feat thermal vision, 60 feet)

**Lore:** The fire doesn't just flow through you—it lives within you. Your pneuma burns hot enough that even your breath carries heat. Those who strike you risk being scorched by your inner flame.

#### Stormborn Strike (Tier 2+)
**Prerequisites:** Pneuma Strike (Air), Air Mastery 4+, Tier 2+

**Benefit:** You've learned to channel lightning's speed and shocking power. Gain the following benefits:

- **Stunning Shock:** When you use Pneuma Strike (Air) and deal lightning damage, if target takes 8+ damage from the strike, they must make Fortitude save vs your Wis + Air Mastery or gain **Dazed** condition (see Conditions document)
- **Static Field:** You gain +1 to initiative (static charge heightens awareness)

**Lore:** Lightning doesn't warn before it strikes. You move with the speed of storms, your blows landing before enemies can react, leaving them reeling from the shock.

#### Earthshaker Fist (Tier 2+)
**Prerequisites:** Pneuma Strike (Earth), Earth Mastery 4+, Might 4+, Tier 2+

**Benefit:** You channel earth's crushing, unyielding force through your strikes. Gain the following benefits:

- **Crushing Impact:** When you use Pneuma Strike (Earth) and deal acid damage, targets must make Fortitude save vs your Wis + Earth Mastery or be knocked **Prone** (see Conditions document)
- **Tremor Strike:** Once per short rest, when you strike the ground (or a solid surface) with Pneuma Strike (Earth), you can affect a 10-foot radius instead of single target. All creatures in area make Reflex save or take damage and fall Prone
- **Stone Stance:** While standing on solid ground, you have Fortune on checks to resist being moved, grappled, or knocked prone

**Lore:** Your strikes carry the weight of mountains. When your fist connects, it's not flesh hitting flesh—it's the inexorable force of stone crushing everything in its path.

### Master Techniques (Tier 3+)

#### Elemental Mantle (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Pneuma Strike (any two elements), Mystic Defense feat, Wis 5, Tier 3+

**Benefit:** You can wrap yourself in elemental energy. As [Minor] action, spend 3 Energy and choose one elemental energy you have Pneuma Strike for:

- **Duration:** 1 minute (concentration)
- **Visual:** Your body becomes wreathed in elemental energy (flames, frost, crackling lightning, or stone armor)
- **Protection:** Gain Resistance (+2 DR) against that element's damage type
- **Retaliation:** Creatures that hit you with melee attacks take 1d8 elemental damage (no weaving check)
- **Enhanced Strikes:** Your unarmed strikes deal +2 damage of that element type (doesn't cost Energy)

**Special:** Can only have one Elemental Mantle active at a time.

**Lore:** You don't just channel elements—you become one with them. Fire dances across your skin, ice crystallizes in your wake, lightning arcs between your fingers, or stone hardens your flesh. The boundary between you and the element blurs.

#### Twin Element Strike (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Pneuma Strike (any two elements), Int 5 or Wis 5, Tier 3+

**Benefit:** You've mastered weaving two elements simultaneously through your strikes. When you use Pneuma Strike, you can spend 4 Energy (instead of 2) to channel two different elements:

- Make weaving checks for BOTH energies simultaneously
- Add successes together to determine total bonus damage dice
- Deal damage split between both element types
- **Example:** Fire (1 success) + Water (2 successes) = 3 total successes = +3d8 damage (split between fire and cold)

**Combining Effects:** If both elements would apply conditions or special effects, target suffers both (if they fail saves).

**Lore:** Most spellcasters struggle to weave even two energies in careful ritual. You've learned to blend them in the chaos of combat, channeling opposing forces through a single strike. Fire and ice, lightning and stone—your pneuma harmonizes contradictions.

#### Pneuma Burst (Tier 4+)
**Prerequisites:** Pneuma Strike (any element), Elemental Burst, any elemental Mastery 6+, Tier 4+

**Benefit:** You've mastered large-scale elemental release. Your Elemental Burst ability improves:

- **Increased Area:** 30-foot cone (instead of 15-foot)
- **Increased Damage:** 
  - 2 successes: 5d8 elemental damage (instead of 3d8)
  - 1 success: 3d8 elemental damage (instead of 2d8)
  - 0 successes: 2d8 elemental damage (instead of 1d8)
- **Lingering Effect:** Creatures that fail their save by 4+ damage also gain appropriate condition:
  - Fire: **Ignited** condition
  - Water: **Frosted** condition  
  - Air: **Disoriented** condition
  - Earth: **Prone** condition

**Lore:** Where once you released energy in a focused wave, now you unleash devastation. Your pneuma explodes outward like a natural disaster made manifest—a firestorm, blizzard, lightning strike, or earthquake concentrated in your fists.

#### Elemental Body (Tier 5+)
**Prerequisites:** Elemental Mantle, any elemental Mastery 7+, Tier 5+

**Benefit:** You can temporarily transform into living elemental energy. As [Combat] action, spend 6 Energy and choose one elemental energy you have Pneuma Strike for:

- **Duration:** 1 minute (concentration)
- **Transformation:** Your body becomes pure elemental energy
- **Immunity:** Immune to that element's damage type
- **Resistance:** Resistance (+4 DR) to all non-magical physical damage
- **Elemental Movement:**
  - Fire: Ignore difficult terrain, leave burning trail
  - Water: Swim speed equal to walking, can pass through 1-inch openings
  - Air: Fly speed equal to walking, can't be grappled
  - Earth: Burrow speed 10 feet, tremorsense 30 feet
- **Elemental Strikes:** All unarmed strikes automatically deal +3d8 elemental damage (no Energy cost, no weaving check)

**Limitations:** Cannot cast weaves while transformed (all pneuma dedicated to maintaining form). Dropping to 0 HP ends transformation immediately.

**Lore:** You've achieved what few martial artists ever dream of—complete unity with an element. You don't channel fire, you ARE fire. You don't manipulate water, you BECOME water. The distinction between your pneuma and elemental energy dissolves entirely.

### Integration Feats (Tier 3+)

#### Elemental Rapid Strikes (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Rapid Strikes feat, Pneuma Strike (any element), Tier 3+

**Benefit:** You can channel elemental energy through your Rapid Strikes flurry. When using Rapid Strikes (3 attacks in one action):

- Choose to spend 4 Energy total (instead of 2 per strike)
- Make ONE weaving check for your chosen element
- Apply the weaving result to ALL THREE strikes
- **1 success:** Each hit deals +1d8 elemental damage
- **2 successes:** Each hit deals +2d8 elemental damage

**Efficiency:** This is more Energy-efficient than using Pneuma Strike three separate times (4 Energy vs 6 Energy), but risks all-or-nothing on single weaving check.

**Lore:** Your flurry becomes a blur of elemental fury. Fire, ice, lightning, or stone—the energy flows through every strike like a continuous stream rather than separate bursts.

#### Stunning Element Strike (Tier 3+)
**Prerequisites:** Stunning Strike feat, Pneuma Strike (any element), Tier 3+

**Benefit:** When you successfully Stun an opponent with Stunning Strike, you can spend an additional 2 Energy to infuse them with elemental energy:

- Choose one element you have Pneuma Strike for
- Target immediately takes 2d8 elemental damage (no weaving check, ignores DR)
- Energy courses through their paralyzed form
- **If Stunned condition ends early:** Target takes additional 1d8 elemental damage as residual energy releases

**Lore:** You don't just interrupt their pneuma flow—you flood it with elemental energy. The shock of foreign pneuma coursing through their meridians is devastating.
