# Ashan
The Ashan are priests of Ja’Alkira. Ja’Alkira is unique to Bellicose and so are its priests. Unlike regular priests who worship and serve the deities of Athelu (even other priests of Alkira), the Ashan are limited in their choice of domains based upon what is known as their calling. 
Ashan are either Priests of War (Y’Ashan) or Priests of Life (N’Ashan).  

## N’Ashan
**Role:** Trained in law and healing, N’Ashan represent the Order prescribed by their God Alkira. Capable combatants, they are a common site on the battlefield using their powers to heal, protect or rebuff enemies. They act as Commissars for the Emperor and the God Alkira, guaranteeing adherence to the principles of Ja’Alkira both on the battlefield and off.

## Y’Ashan
**Role:** Trained in Law, Y’Ashan are engines of destruction on the battlefield, serving in the name of their God Alkira. Capable combatants, they reign down fiery destruction on the enemies of the empire. Like their brothers the N’Ashan, they act as Commissars for the Emperor and the God Alkira guaranteeing adherence to the principles of Ja’Alkira both on the battlefield and off.
