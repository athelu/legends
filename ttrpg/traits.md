# D8 TTRPG - Part 4: Traits

## TRAITS (Cost Points)

**Design Philosophy:** Traits are reserved for abilities that grant unique resource systems (Energy pools, special points), supernatural characteristics, or features that cannot be learned through normal training. Most combat abilities and "class features" are now available as feats.

## NOTES ON REMOVED TRAITS

The following traits have been **removed** from the system. Their core abilities are now available as **feats** that any character can take if they meet the prerequisites:

### Former Martial Traits (Now Feats)
-   **Martial Prowess** - Combat abilities like Action Surge, Second Wind, Battle Master maneuvers are now individual feats
-   **Roguish Training** - Sneak Attack, Cunning Action, etc. are now individual feats
-   **Ranger's Path** - Hunter's Mark, Favored Enemy, etc. are now individual feats  
-   **Monastic Training** - Flurry of Blows, Unarmored Defense, etc. are now individual feats

This change supports the classless design philosophy: any character who meets the prerequisites can learn these abilities through training (purchasing feats with XP).

## WISDOM ON TRAIT SELECTION

**When to take a trait:**
-   You want to play a spellcaster (Mageborn, Divine Gift, Sorcerous Origin, Eldritch Pact, Invoker, Infuser, Divine Warrior)
-   You want a supernatural characteristic (Immortality, Mythic Characteristic)
-   You want a permanent passive benefit that defines your character (Eidetic Memory, Lightning Reflexes)
-   You want a supernatural characteristic (Immortality, Mythic Characteristic)
-   You want a permanent passive benefit that defines your character (Eidetic Memory, Lightning Reflexes)

**When NOT to take a trait:**
-   You want combat abilities → Use feats instead
-   You want class features → Use feats instead
-   You want skills → Use XP and backgrounds instead

The trait system is now focused and purposeful, reserving its mechanical weight for truly exceptional or supernatural capabilities.

## MAGICAL TRAITS

### Mageborn (-7)
**Requirements:** Intelligence ≥ 3

You were born with an innate connection to the planes flowing through your pneuma. Your eyes glow with constant violet light, marking you as a mage from birth. Through careful study and understanding of magical theory, you have learned to channel the eight energies through precise intellectual control.

**Visual Effects:** Your weaves manifest with orbiting glyphs, bright flashes of violet light, and cascading magical symbols. Motes of energy trail from your gestures, and your magic leaves shimmering afterimages in the air. Your eyes never stop glowing—the violet light is constant, marking you as mageborn to all who see you.

**Mechanical Benefits:**
-   Roll **8d8**, assign to eight Magical Potentials
-   Choose **Elemental Affinity** (Earth/Air/Fire/Water): That Potential = highest roll + 2 (max 8)
-   Choose **Secondary Focus** (any other energy): That Potential = any other roll + 1
-   Use **Intelligence** as Casting Stat
-   Gain **8 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to the 8 energies (start at rank 0, untrained)
-   Can weave arcane magic using all 8 energies
-   **Energy Pool:** Sum of 8 Potentials + (Intelligence × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)
-   **Gain Ritual Casting ability:** Can cast any weave as a 10-minute ritual for half Energy cost (minimum 1). Cannot be used in combat.

### Divine Gift (-7)
**Requirements:** Wisdom ≥ 3

You have been blessed by divine forces, your pneuma opened to channel sacred power through faith and spiritual connection. Unlike mages whose eyes always glow, your eyes flash with violet light only upon the completion of each weave with the divine energies flowing through you at the moment of manifestation.

**Visual Effects:** When you complete a weave, your eyes blaze with violet light. Divine symbols and holy glyphs swirl around you, and cascades of sacred energy ripple outward. Between castings, your eyes appear normal, but the moment you channel divine power, they illuminate with unmistakable radiance.

**Mechanical Benefits:**
-   Roll **8d8**, assign to eight Magical Potentials
-   **Choose Divine Path:**
    -   **Cleric Path (Good):** Choose Positive as Divine Affinity.
        Positive = highest roll + 2 (max 8), Negative = any other roll + 1

    -   **Death Cleric Path (Evil):** Choose Negative as Divine Affinity.
        Negative = highest roll + 2 (max 8), Positive = any other roll + 1

    -   **Druid Path (Neutral):** Choose Elemental Affinity (Earth, Air, Fire, or
        Water) = highest roll + 2 (max 8), and choose Positive = any other roll + 1

    -   **Blight Druid Path (Evil):** Choose Elemental Affinity (Earth, Air, Fire, or
        Water) = highest roll + 2 (max 8), and choose Negative = any other roll + 1
-   Use **Wisdom** as Casting Stat
-   Gain **8 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to the 8 energies (start at rank 0, untrained)
-   Can weave divine magic using all 8 energies
-   **Energy Pool:** Sum of 8 Potentials + (Wisdom × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)
-   **Gain Channel Divinity ability**

### Invoker (-5)
**Requirements:** Charisma ≥ 3

You have discovered the connection between spoken words and magic. You are a diabolist. Awakened to magical power through research or accident rather than born with it. Through study and practice, you learned that certain sounds and syllables are the true names of forces and concepts and have inherent power when spoken by one who understands them. Your eyes glow with violet light only when you complete a weave, the power manifesting as the final syllable leaves your lips.

**Visual Effects:** When you speak true names, the syllables manifest as visible violet light in the air. Ancient glyphs and runic symbols materialize around you as each word of power is pronounced. Your eyes flash with violet radiance when the weave completes, then return to normal. The words themselves seem to echo with unnatural resonance, leaving shimmering afterimages of sound made visible.

**The True Names:** These words of power are rarely from any spoken language known to scholars. They may be fragments of primordial speech, echoes from the outer planes, or sounds that existed before language itself. Each invoker's pronunciation is unique. What matters is understanding the concept behind the sound, not perfect replication.

**Mechanical Benefits:**
-   Roll **5d8**, assign to five Magical Potentials:
-   **Air Potential** = highest roll + 2 (max 8) [always primary - sound, voice, resonance]
-   **Positive Potential** = second-highest roll + 1 [true names of healing and life]
-   **Space Potential** = any remaining roll [names of distance and perception]
-   **Time Potential** = any remaining roll [names of duration and causality]
-   **Choose one Elemental or Conceptual energy** (Earth, Fire, Water, or Negative): assign final roll
-   Use **Charisma** as Casting Stat
-   Gain **5 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to your 5 energies (start at rank 0, untrained)
-   Can weave invoker magic using only these 5 energies
-   **Energy Pool:** Sum of 5 Potentials + (Charisma × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)
-   **Gain Words of Power ability:** Once per short rest, spend 1 [Combat] action to speak a word of power. All allies you can see within 30 feet subtract 1 from both dice on their next roll.

**Invoker Requirement:** You must have line of sight to targets of your weaves. If you cannot see your target, you cannot speak their true name or bind them with your magic. This replaces typical targeting requirements for spells.

**Elemental True Name Themes:**
-   **Fire**: Names of combustion, heat, passion, destruction
-   **Water**: Names of flow, cold, adaptation, persistence  
-   **Earth**: Names of stone, stability, growth, endurance
-   **Negative**: Names of entropy, shadow, endings, void

### Infuser (-5)
**Requirements:** Intelligence ≥ 3

You have discovered how to channel magical energy directly into physical objects. You are a diabolist—awakened to magical power through research and experimentation rather than born with it. Through careful study of how pneuma interacts with matter, you learned to infuse temporary magical properties into items, creating enchanted objects that hold power for brief periods. Your eyes glow with violet light only when you complete an infusion, the moment magical energy flows from your pneuma into the object.

**Visual Effects:** When you infuse an object, violet light flows from your hands into the item like liquid energy. Glyphs and symbols briefly shimmer across the object's surface before fading into the material itself. Your eyes flash with violet radiance as the infusion completes, then return to normal. Infused items glow faintly with violet light while holding your magic, and leave trailing motes of energy when used.

**The Art of Infusion:** Unlike mages who channel energy through themselves, or invokers who speak power into being, you transfer magical energy directly from your pneuma into physical objects. The object becomes a temporary reservoir of power, holding the effect until triggered or until the magic fades. This requires understanding both magical theory and the material properties of what you're enchanting.

**Mechanical Benefits:**
-   Roll **5d8**, assign to five Magical Potentials:
-   **Earth Potential** = highest roll + 2 (max 8) [always primary - matter, material, physical permanence]
-   **Space Potential** = second-highest roll + 1 [barriers, protection, containment]
-   **Positive Potential** = any remaining roll [enhancement, strengthening, preservation]
-   **Time Potential** = any remaining roll [duration, maintaining effects]
-   **Choose one Elemental or Conceptual energy** (Air, Fire, Water, or Negative): assign final roll
-   Use **Intelligence** as Casting Stat
-   Gain **5 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to your 5 energies (start at rank 0, untrained)
-   Can weave infuser magic using only these 5 energies
-   **Energy Pool:** Sum of 5 Potentials + (Intelligence × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)
-   **Gain Imbue Item ability:** Once per short rest, spend 1 [Combat] action and touch a weapon or piece of armor. For 1 minute, the item gains one benefit: weapons deal +1d8 damage on next hit, or armor grants +1 DR. The infusion ends after triggering once or when duration expires.

**Infuser Requirement:** You must touch an object to infuse it with magic. Most of your weaves require physical contact with the target or a material component you're manipulating. You cannot cast at range without an infused item as an intermediary.

**Elemental Infusion Themes:**
-   **Air**: Lightning-charged weapons, items that crackle with static, wind-enhanced movement
-   **Fire**: Flame-wreathed weapons, heat-radiating armor, burning enchantments
-   **Water**: Frost-touched items, flowing defensive wards, adaptive protections
-   **Negative**: Withering weapons, life-draining effects, entropic decay infusions



### Sorcerous Origin (-7)
**Requirements:** Charisma ≥ 3

Innate magical power flows through your bloodline. You are mageborn and your eyes glow constantly with violet light from birth, marking your inherent connection to the planes. Unlike wizard mages who study and understand magic intellectually, your power flows from raw force of personality and unshakeable sense of self.

**Visual Effects:** Your weaves crackle with wild, barely-contained energy. Violet light constantly emanates from your eyes, and when you cast, the magic erupts in dramatic bursts. Glyphs and symbols swirl chaotically around you, responding to your will rather than careful control. Your bloodline's influence is visible in your magic's aesthetic.

**Mechanical Benefits:**
-   Roll **8d8**, assign to eight Magical Potentials
-   **Choose Sorcerous Origin:** Determines which energy gets highest affinity and special abilities
    - **Draconic Bloodline:** Choose elemental (Fire/Water/Earth/Air) = highest roll + 2 (max 8). Gain draconic resilience.
    - **Wild Magic:** Choose any energy = highest roll + 2 (max 8). Chaos infuses your magic.
    - **Divine Soul:** Choose Positive or Negative = highest roll + 2 (max 8). Divine power flows through you.
    - **Storm Sorcery:** Air = highest roll + 2 (max 8). Storm magic crackles around you.
    - **Shadow Magic:** Negative = highest roll + 2 (max 8). Darkness is your ally.
-   Choose **Secondary Focus** (any other energy): That Potential = any other roll + 1
-   Use **Charisma** as Casting Stat
-   Gain **8 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to the 8 energies (start at rank 0, untrained)
-   Can weave sorcerous magic using all 8 energies
-   **Energy Pool:** Sum of 8 Potentials + (Charisma × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)
-   **Gain Sorcery Points:** Pool equal to your Charisma score. Regain all points after long rest. Can spend for metamagic effects (see Metamagic feats).

**Origin Benefits:**
-   **Draconic Bloodline:** +1 max HP per tier, DR = 1 when unarmored
-   **Wild Magic:** Roll on Wild Magic table whenever you roll double 1s or 8s while weaving
-   **Divine Soul:** Can use Channel Divinity once per long rest (costs 4 Energy minimum)
-   **Storm Sorcery:** When you weave with Air energy, you can fly 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks
-   **Shadow Magic:** Subtract 1 from both dice on Stealth checks in dim light or darkness

### Eldritch Pact (-7)
**Requirements:** Charisma ≥ 3

You've made a pact with an otherworldly patron for power. You are a diabolist. Awakened to magic through extraordinary circumstances rather than born with it. Your eyes glow with violet light only when you complete a weave, the power flowing from your patron through your pneuma at the moment of casting.

**Visual Effects:** When you weave, your eyes flash with violet light and your patron's influence is unmistakable—alien geometries, fel flames, celestial radiance, or shadowy tendrils manifest around you. Between castings, your eyes appear normal, but careful observers might notice subtle signs of your pact (strange reflections, unnatural shadows, or otherworldly glimmers).

**Mechanical Benefits:**
-   Roll **5d8**, assign to five Magical Potentials based on patron
-   **Choose Patron:** Determines energy access and grants patron gift
    - **Archfey:** Air (highest +2), Positive (any +1), Space, Time, Earth
    - **Fiend:** Fire (highest +2), Negative (any +1), Space, Time, Water
    - **Great Old One:** Space (highest +2), Negative (any +1), Air, Time, Water
    - **Celestial:** Positive (highest +2), Fire (any +1), Space, Time, Air
    - **Hexblade:** Negative (highest +2), Space (any +1), Fire, Earth, Time
-   Use **Charisma** as Casting Stat
-   Gain **5 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to your 5 energies (start at rank 0, untrained)
-   Can weave eldritch magic using only these 5 energies
-   **Energy Pool:** Sum of 5 Potentials + (Charisma × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)
-   **Pact Magic:** Energy regenerates on **short rest** instead of long rest
-   **Patron Gift:** Gain special ability based on patron choice

**Patron Gifts:**
-   **Archfey:** Once per short rest, as 1 [Combat] action, target within 30 feet makes Will save. If you win, target is Charmed for 1 minute.
-   **Fiend:** When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 HP, gain temporary HP equal to your Charisma + tier.
-   **Great Old One:** You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet (no shared language needed).
-   **Celestial:** Your healing weaves restore an additional amount equal to your Charisma score.
-   **Hexblade:** You can use Charisma instead of Strength or Agility for attack and damage rolls with one chosen weapon.

### Divine Warrior (-5)
**Requirements:** Wisdom ≥ 3, Charisma ≥ 3

Spiritual warrior bound by sacred oath. You channel divine power through faith and martial prowess, your pneuma opened through devotion to your cause. Your eyes glow with violet light only when completing a weave. Between castings your eyes appear normal, but flash with divine radiance when you channel sacred power.

**Visual Effects:** When you weave or use divine abilities, your eyes blaze with violet light and holy (or unholy) symbols manifest around you. Your oath's energy crackles along your weapon and armor. Sacred (or profane) glyphs orbit your form, and divine power ripples outward with each manifestation.

**Mechanical Benefits:**

Spiritual warrior bound by sacred oath. Choose your **Sacred Oath:**

**Good/Neutral Oaths:**
- **Devotion:** Positive +2, Space +1 (protection, healing, positioning)

**Limited Divine Weaving:**

  - **Primary Energy** (Positive or Negative based on oath) = highest roll + oath bonus (max 8)
  - **Secondary Energy** (from oath) = second-highest roll + oath bonus
  - Assign remaining two rolls to two other energies of your choice (Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Space, Time, or the opposite divine energy)

- Gain **4 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to your 4 energies (start rank 0)
- Can weave divine magic using only these 4 energies
- **Energy Pool:** Sum of 4 Potentials + (Charisma × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)
- Energy regenerates on **short rest** (unlike full casters who need long rest)
