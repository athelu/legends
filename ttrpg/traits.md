# D8 TTRPG - Part 4: Traits
## NOTES ON REMOVED TRAITS

The following traits have been **removed** from the system. Their core abilities are now available as **feats** that any character can take if they meet the prerequisites:

### Former Martial Traits (Now Feats)
-   **Martial Prowess** - Combat abilities like Action Surge, Second Wind, Battle Master maneuvers are now individual feats
-   **Roguish Training** - Sneak Attack, Cunning Action, etc. are now individual feats
-   **Ranger's Path** - Hunter's Mark, Favored Enemy, etc. are now individual feats  
-   **Monastic Training** - Flurry of Blows, Unarmored Defense, etc. are now individual feats

This change supports the classless design philosophy: any character who meets the prerequisites can learn these abilities through training (purchasing feats with XP).

## WISDOM ON TRAIT SELECTION

**When to take a trait:**
-   You want to play a spellcaster (Magical Aptitude, Divine Gift, Bardic Magic, Divine Warrior)
-   You want a supernatural characteristic (Immortality, Mythic Characteristic)
-   You want a permanent passive benefit that defines your character (Eidetic Memory, Lightning Reflexes)

**When NOT to take a trait:**
-   You want combat abilities → Use feats instead
-   You want class features → Use feats instead
-   You want skills → Use XP and backgrounds instead

The trait system is now focused and purposeful, reserving its mechanical weight for truly exceptional or supernatural capabilities.


## TRAITS (Cost Points)

**Design Philosophy:** Traits are reserved for abilities that grant unique resource systems (Energy pools, special points), supernatural characteristics, or features that cannot be learned through normal training. Most combat abilities and "class features" are now available as feats.
