## Evil Divine Casters

### Dragon Cult Devotee

For evil characters who worship the ancient daemons known as Dragons instead of the Pantheon of Eight.

**Patron Options (choose one of the eight dragons):**
1. **Aq-Yin-To** - Water Dragon
2. **Char-Talt** - Air Dragon
3. **Har-Ten-Mo** - Earth Dragon
4. **Kylo** - Fire Dragon
5. **Luk-Anda** - Positive Dragon
6. **Sein-Tuk-Tak** - Negative Dragon
7. **Tiet-Amor** - Time Dragon
8. **Garro-Leth** - Space Dragon

**Mechanical Framework:**
- Use the same mechanical structure as Divine Gift
- Dragon patron determines Primary (+2) and Secondary (+1) energy based on dragon's nature
- Channel Divinity options are corrupted/twisted versions of the Eight's abilities
- GM should create custom Channel Divinity options reflecting the dragon's personality and goals

**Flavor:** Dragon cultists believe dragons were/are the true gods, superior to the Eight. Their magic is dark, selfish, and corrupting.

### Twisted Denomination

For characters who worship a corrupted version of one of the Eight.

**Examples:**
- **Ja'Alkira Extremists** (Bellicose) - Believe only Alkira matters, rejecting the other seven. Mechanically identical to Alkira patron but with fanatical roleplay.
- **Death Cult of Nevil** - Worship Nevil as god of murder and undeath rather than natural death. Same mechanics as Nevil patron but perverted purpose.
- **Tyrant's Justice** - Athore worship twisted to oppression, cruelty, and tyranny rather than righteous justice.
- **Dark Fortune** - Rudlu worship focused on cursing enemies and stealing luck rather than playful trickery.

**Mechanical Framework:**
- Choose one of the Eight as patron
- Use normal Divine Gift mechanics for that deity
- Flavor and roleplay reflect the corruption
- GM may impose consequences for betraying the deity's true nature (loss of powers, divine retribution, etc.)

### Invoker (-5)
**Requirements:** Charisma ≥ 3

You have discovered the connection between spoken words and magic. You are a diabolist. Awakened to magical power through research or accident rather than born with it. Through study and practice, you learned that certain sounds and syllables are the true names of forces and concepts and have inherent power when spoken by one who understands them. Your eyes glow with violet light only when you complete a weave, the power manifesting as the final syllable leaves your lips.

**Visual Effects:** When you speak true names, the syllables manifest as visible violet light in the air. Ancient glyphs and runic symbols materialize around you as each word of power is pronounced. Your eyes flash with violet radiance when the weave completes, then return to normal. The words themselves seem to echo with unnatural resonance, leaving shimmering afterimages of sound made visible.

**The True Names:** These words of power are rarely from any spoken language known to scholars. They may be fragments of primordial speech, echoes from the outer planes, or sounds that existed before language itself. Each invoker's pronunciation is unique. What matters is understanding the concept behind the sound, not perfect replication.

**Mechanical Benefits:**
-   Roll **5d8**, assign to five Magical Potentials:
-   **Air Potential** = highest roll + 2 (max 8) [always primary - sound, voice, resonance]
-   **Positive Potential** = second-highest roll + 1 [true names of healing and life]
-   **Space Potential** = any remaining roll [names of distance and perception]
-   **Time Potential** = any remaining roll [names of duration and causality]
-   **Choose one Elemental or Conceptual energy** (Earth, Fire, Water, or Negative): assign final roll
-   Use **Charisma** as Casting Stat
-   Gain **5 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to your 5 energies (start at rank 0, untrained)
-   Can weave invoker magic using only these 5 energies
-   **Energy Pool:** Sum of 5 Potentials + (Charisma × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)
-   **Gain Words of Power ability:** Once per short rest, spend 1 [Combat] action to speak a word of power. All allies you can see within 30 feet subtract 1 from both dice on their next roll.

**Invoker Requirement:** You must have line of sight to targets of your weaves. If you cannot see your target, you cannot speak their true name or bind them with your magic. This replaces typical targeting requirements for spells.

**Elemental True Name Themes:**
-   **Fire**: Names of combustion, heat, passion, destruction
-   **Water**: Names of flow, cold, adaptation, persistence  
-   **Earth**: Names of stone, stability, growth, endurance
-   **Negative**: Names of entropy, shadow, endings, void

### Infuser (-5)
**Requirements:** Intelligence ≥ 3

You have discovered how to channel magical energy directly into physical objects. You are a diabolist—awakened to magical power through research and experimentation rather than born with it. Through careful study of how pneuma interacts with matter, you learned to infuse temporary magical properties into items, creating enchanted objects that hold power for brief periods. Your eyes glow with violet light only when you complete an infusion, the moment magical energy flows from your pneuma into the object.

**Visual Effects:** When you infuse an object, violet light flows from your hands into the item like liquid energy. Glyphs and symbols briefly shimmer across the object's surface before fading into the material itself. Your eyes flash with violet radiance as the infusion completes, then return to normal. Infused items glow faintly with violet light while holding your magic, and leave trailing motes of energy when used.

**The Art of Infusion:** Unlike mages who channel energy through themselves, or invokers who speak power into being, you transfer magical energy directly from your pneuma into physical objects. The object becomes a temporary reservoir of power, holding the effect until triggered or until the magic fades. This requires understanding both magical theory and the material properties of what you're enchanting.

**Mechanical Benefits:**
-   Roll **5d8**, assign to five Magical Potentials:
-   **Earth Potential** = highest roll + 2 (max 8) [always primary - matter, material, physical permanence]
-   **Space Potential** = second-highest roll + 1 [barriers, protection, containment]
-   **Positive Potential** = any remaining roll [enhancement, strengthening, preservation]
-   **Time Potential** = any remaining roll [duration, maintaining effects]
-   **Choose one Elemental or Conceptual energy** (Air, Fire, Water, or Negative): assign final roll
-   Use **Intelligence** as Casting Stat
-   Gain **5 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to your 5 energies (start at rank 0, untrained)
-   Can weave infuser magic using only these 5 energies
-   **Energy Pool:** Sum of 5 Potentials + (Intelligence × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)
-   **Gain Imbue Item ability:** Once per short rest, spend 1 [Combat] action and touch a weapon or piece of armor. For 1 minute, the item gains one benefit: weapons deal +1d8 damage on next hit, or armor grants +1 DR. The infusion ends after triggering once or when duration expires.

**Infuser Requirement:** You must touch an object to infuse it with magic. Most of your weaves require physical contact with the target or a material component you're manipulating. You cannot cast at range without an infused item as an intermediary.

**Elemental Infusion Themes:**
-   **Air**: Lightning-charged weapons, items that crackle with static, wind-enhanced movement
-   **Fire**: Flame-wreathed weapons, heat-radiating armor, burning 
-   **Water**: Frost-touched items, flowing defensive wards, adaptive protections
-   **Negative**: Withering weapons, life-draining effects, entropic decay infusions


### Sorcerous Origin (-7)
**Requirements:** Wisdom ≥ 3

You are an Arcanisty, your eyes glow with constant violet light from birth, marking your inherent connection to the planes. Unlike Mageborn who study magic intellectually or clerics who channel divine power, your magic flows from perfect self-knowledge and unshakeable inner certainty. Your pneuma is so clear, so completely understood, that reality itself recognizes and responds to your true nature. You don't need to understand *how* magic works—you *know* what you are, and that truth manifests as power.

**The Source of Power:**
Where Mageborn study external principles and clerics channel external deities, sorcerers have achieved something rarer: **perfect internal understanding**. You've looked within and seen yourself completely—not your surface thoughts or emotions, but your fundamental nature across space, time, and probability. This enlightenment isn't intellectual (that's wizardry) or spiritual devotion (that's divine casting)—it's absolute self-perception. Reality cannot deny a truth perceived so clearly.

**Visual Effects:** Your weaves flow naturally, almost effortlessly, as if reality is simply acknowledging what already is. Violet light constantly emanates from your eyes—not flickering like other mageborn, but steady, like a candle that never wavers. When you cast, magic moves through you like water finding its level, inevitable and serene. Your Force of Will manifestation determines how this manifests aesthetically.

**Mechanical Benefits:**
-   Roll **8d8**, assign to eight Magical Potentials
-   **Choose Force of Will Manifestation:** Determines which energy aligns with your deepest truth and grants unique benefits

#### Unchanging Stone (Earth/Fire)
**Story:** *"I know my nature completely—I am solid as stone, constant as truth"*
**Primary Energy:** Choose Earth or Fire = highest roll + 2 (max 8)
**Manifestation Benefits:**
-   **Stone's Certainty:** Subtract 1 from both dice on saves against effects that would change your form or nature (Beastial Transformation, petrification, forced movement, mind control that alters personality)
-   **Enduring Form:** +1 max HP per tier, DR = 1 when unarmored

#### Thread of Fate (Time/Positive)
**Story:** *"I perceive my place in the pattern—I see where I'm meant to be"*
**Primary Energy:** Choose Time or Positive = highest roll + 2 (max 8)
**Manifestation Benefits:**
-   **Fate's Insight:** Once per long rest, reroll any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check after seeing the result
-   **Glimpse Ahead:** Once per short rest, gain a cryptic one-sentence hint about immediate danger or opportunity in the next 10 minutes (ask GM)

#### Death's Lesson (Fire/Negative)
**Story:** *"I understand survival is my truth—I've seen death and know it's not my path"*
**Primary Energy:** Choose Fire or Negative = highest roll + 2 (max 8)
**Manifestation Benefits:**
-   **Survivor's Truth:** When reduced below half HP, gain Fortune on your next weaving roll and temporary HP equal to your Wisdom (once per long rest)
-   **Death's Defiance:** Subtract 1 from both dice when making death saves

#### Perfect Self-Perception (Space/Air)
**Story:** *"I perceive myself completely across space and time—I exist in total self-awareness"*
**Primary Energy:** Choose Space or Air = highest roll + 2 (max 8)
**Manifestation Benefits:**
-   **Omnipresent Mind:** Add your Wisdom to initiative. Once per short rest, as [Free] action, perceive from any point within 60 feet for 1 round
-   **Mental Clarity:** Subtract 1 from both dice on saves against mental effects (Charmed, Frightened, possession)

**Common Mechanical Elements:**
-   Choose **Secondary Focus** (any other energy): That Potential = any other roll + 1
-   Use **Wisdom** as Casting Stat
-   Gain **8 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to the 8 energies (start at rank 0, untrained)
-   Can weave sorcerous magic using all 8 energies
-   **Energy Pool:** Sum of 8 Potentials + (Wisdom × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)

**Sorcerer Signature Abilities:**
-   **Resonant Weaving (Passive):** You ignore the first point of overspending penalty on all energy types. If you have Fire Mastery 4 and spend 6 Energy (2 over), you only add +1 to both dice instead of +2
-   **Harmonic Weaving:** When you make a weaving roll, you can declare "Harmonic" to reroll one die (Potential OR Mastery, your choice). You must take the new result. You can use this ability a number of times per long rest equal to your Wisdom + Tier

**Visual Aesthetics by Manifestation:**
-   **Unchanging Stone:** Weaves manifest as solid, geometric constructs—crystalline shields, perfectly straight beams, enduring walls of force
-   **Thread of Fate:** Weaves shimmer with silver-white threads, as if woven from probability itself, showing glimpses of what must be
-   **Death's Lesson:** Weaves burn with fierce, defiant energy—not chaotic but purposeful, like a forge fire that refuses to die
-   **Perfect Self-Perception:** Weaves are impossibly precise, beautiful in their symmetry, reflecting your complete awareness of position and form
"

### Eldritch Pact (-7)
**Requirements:** Charisma ≥ 3

You are a diabolist—awakened to magical power through trauma rather than born with it. At some moment of desperate need, when death seemed certain or loss unbearable, you reached out to *anything* that might answer. Something did. You don't fully understand what you called to, what answered, or what price you'll pay. You only know that power came when you needed it most, and now you're bound to something beyond mortal understanding.

Your eyes glow with violet light only when you complete a weave, the power flowing from your pact through your pneuma at the moment of casting.

**Visual Effects:** When you weave, your eyes flash with violet light and your pact's influence is unmistakable. Between castings, your eyes appear normal, but careful observers might notice subtle signs like strange reflections, unnatural shadows, or otherworldly glimmers. The nature of what you've bound yourself to manifests in your magic's appearance.

**Mechanical Benefits:**
-   Roll **5d8**, assign to five Magical Potentials based on pact type
-   **Choose Survival Pact Type:** Determines energy access and how the pact manifests

#### The Survivor's Bargain
**Energies:** Space (highest +2), Negative (any +1), Fire, Earth, Time
**Story:** *You should have died. You didn't. Something intervened.*
**Pact Conduit - Scavenged Power:** When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 HP, immediately regain Energy equal to your tier (minimum 2). Your patron feeds on endings.
**Pact Gift:** When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 HP, gain temporary HP equal to your Charisma + tier

#### The Desperate Deal
**Energies:** Positive (highest +2), Space (any +1), Air, Time, Water
**Story:** *You promised something to someone in your darkest hour. Power came immediately.*
**Pact Conduit - Borrowed Vitality:** Whenever you weave using Positive energy as primary or supporting, the target (or you, if healing self) gains +4 temporary HP that lasts until your next short rest. Life borrowed is life shared.
**Pact Gift:** Once per short rest, as [Combat] action, heal yourself or touched ally for HP equal to Charisma × tier

#### The Answered Cry
**Energies:** Air (highest +2), Negative (any +1), Space, Time, Water
**Story:** *You screamed into the void. The void answered.*
**Pact Conduit - Void Resonance:** Whenever you weave using Air or Space as primary energy, you can target one additional creature within range (make separate weaving rolls for each). The void spreads your intent.
**Pact Gift:** You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet

#### The Stolen Shard
**Energies:** Fire (highest +2), Negative (any +1), Space, Earth, Time
**Story:** *You found/touched/stole something not meant for you. This power wasn't offered—you took it.*
**Pact Conduit - Unstable Surge:** Whenever you weave using your Primary Energy (Fire), add +4 damage OR extend duration by 1 round. Power stolen doesn't flow smoothly—it erupts.
**Pact Gift:** Once per short rest, as [Combat] action, target within 30 feet makes Will save (your Charisma + Fire Mastery vs their Wisdom + Luck). If you win by 1+ successes, target is Frightened for 1 minute (they can repeat save each turn)

**Common Mechanical Elements:**
-   Use **Charisma** as Casting Stat
-   Gain **5 Magical Mastery skills** corresponding to your 5 energies (start at rank 0, untrained)
-   Can weave eldritch magic using only these 5 energies
-   **Energy Pool:** Sum of 5 Potentials + (Charisma × 2) + Con + (Total Mastery ÷ 2)
-   **Pact Magic:** Energy regenerates on **short rest** instead of long rest

**Pact Nature (Roleplay Guidance):**
-   **Survivor's Bargain:** You might not even know what intervened. Could be anything. Possibly doesn't even know you exist—you may have stolen its power accidentally. Your magic feels scavenged, cobbled together.
-   **Desperate Deal:** Something deliberately vague answered. Uses euphemisms. Never appears directly. Sends signs, omens, whispers. You agreed without reading the contract. Your magic feels like borrowed tools—functional but foreign.
-   **Answered Cry:** Silent. Watchful. Grants power but gives no guidance. Feels like being observed constantly. You don't know if it's good/evil/neutral or what it wants from you. Your magic feels like a gift from an absent benefactor.
-   **Stolen Shard:** Might not even be sentient—could be residual power from dead entity, trapped daemon, or lost fragment of god. You don't know if the original owner wants it back or if taking it cursed you. Your magic feels unstable, like wielding something too powerful for mortal hands.
