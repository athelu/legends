# D8 TTRPG - Part 2: Character Creation

## Character Attributes

### The Eight Core Attributes (1-8 scale)
1.  Strength - Physical power, lifting, breaking
2.  Constitution - Health, endurance, resilience
3.  Agility - Speed, reflexes, combat movement
4.  Dexterity - Fine motor skills, precision, crafting
5.  Intelligence - Reasoning, knowledge, magical theory
6.  Wisdom - Intuition, perception, spiritual connection
7.  Charisma - Personality, leadership, social influence
8.  Luck - Fortune, fate, cosmic favor

### Starting Attribute Array

Players assign the following values to their eight attributes: 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1

### Hit Points
HP = Constitution × 8

#### Skill Limits

### Traits and Flaws (Advantages/Disadvantages)

#### Core Rule

    magical) or purchase feats

##### Attributes: 16 × current rank (double skill cost)
-   **Example:** Rank 3→4 costs 48 XP

##### Potentials: 16 × current rank (same as attributes, only for characters with magical abilities)
-   **Example:** Fire Potential 5→6 costs 80 XP
