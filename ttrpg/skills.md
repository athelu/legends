## Using Skills in Play

### Skill Checks
When the GM calls for a skill check:
1. Determine if the task is Simple (1 success) or Hard (2 successes)
2. Roll your governing Attribute die + Skill die
3. Count successes (rolling under the value = success, natural 1 = always success)
4. Compare to the required successes

### Opposed Checks
Some skills are opposed by another character's skill:
- **Stealth vs. Perception:** Sneaking past a guard
- **Deception vs. Empathy:** Lying to someone
- **Thievery vs. Perception:** Pickpocketing

Both sides roll their relevant skills and count successes. Higher successes wins.

### Combat Skills
Melee Combat and Ranged Combat are used for attacking:
- **Melee Combat:** Opposed rolls against opponent's Melee Combat
- **Ranged Combat:** Fixed difficulty based on range (see Combat rules)

### Skill Synergy
The GM may grant Fortune or subtract penalties when multiple skills could apply:
- Using Investigate + History to analyze ancient ruins
- Using Wilderness + Medicine to create natural remedies
- Using Society + Deception to blend into a noble gathering

### Taking Your Time
When not under time pressure, the GM may allow you to automatically succeed at Simple tasks if your skill rank is 3+, or at Hard tasks if your skill rank is 6+.
