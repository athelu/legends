# D8 TTRPG Part 10: Weaves

## Using This Guide

Each weave entry includes:
-   **Primary Energy:** The energy that creates the core effect
-   **Supporting Energy:** Optional energies for range, area, or duration
-   **Base Cost:** Typical energy point investment
-   **Action Cost:** Simple (1 action) or Complex (2 actions)
-   **Effect:** What the weave does and how it scales with successes

**Remember:** You can adjust energy expenditure to increase damage, range, area, or duration. Overspending beyond your Mastery adds penalties.

### Notes on Weave Design
-   Energy costs can be adjusted by weavers (spend more for more damage, larger area, etc.)
-   Success scaling shows what happens at different weaving success levels
-   Complex weaves (2 actions) are typically save-based or have area effects
-   Simple weaves (1 action) are typically direct effects or touch range
-   Weavers can combine energies creatively
-   Increase Damage: Spend 2 more Energy per damage tier (8/16/24/32)
-   Increase Range: +1 Energy per range increment (Touch/Close/Medium/Long)
-   Increase Area: +1 Energy per area increase (single, 2 targets/10ft. 4 targets/20ft, 6 targets/30ft)
-   Increase Duration: +1 Energy per duration step (instant/1 round/1minute/10 minutes/1 hour)
-   Overspending Penalty Remember: Spending Energy beyond your Mastery in that energy type adds +1 to both dice per point over. Plan your weaves within your capabilities or accept the penalty for heroic moments!
-   These weaves are guidelines. Work with your GM to create unique effects by combining energies in new ways. The eight energies are tools
