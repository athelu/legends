# D8 TTRPG Part 10: Weaves

## Using This Guide

Each weave entry includes:
**Primary Energy:** The energy that creates the core effect
**Supporting Energy:** Optional energies for range, area, or duration
**Base Cost:** Typical energy point investment
**Action Cost:** Simple (1 action) or Complex (2 actions)
**Effect:** What the weave does and how it scales with successes

**Remember:** You can adjust energy expenditure to increase damage, range, area, or duration. Overspending beyond your Mastery adds penalties.

### Notes on Weave Design
Energy costs can be adjusted by weavers (spend more for more damage, larger area, etc.)
Success scaling shows what happens at different weaving success levels
Complex weaves (2 actions) are typically save-based or have area effects
Simple weaves (1 action) are typically direct effects or touch range
Weavers can combine energies creatively
Increase Damage: Spend 2 more Energy per damage tier (8/16/24/32)
Increase Range: +1 Energy per range increment (Touch/Close/Medium/Long)
Increase Area: +1 Energy per area increase (single, 2 targets/10ft. 4 targets/20ft, 6 targets/30ft)
Increase Duration: +1 Energy per duration step (instant/1 round/1minute/10 minutes/1 hour)
Overspending Penalty Remember: Spending Energy beyond your Mastery in that energy type adds +1 to both dice per point over. Plan your weaves within your capabilities or accept the penalty for heroic moments!
These weaves are guidelines. Work with your GM to create unique effects by combining energies in new ways. The eight energies are tools

## A

**Saving Throw:** None (attack weave, weaving successes determine hit quality)
**Damage Type:** Acid (energy)
**DR Interaction:** Half DR (8 acid damage vs DR 4 becomes 8 - 2 = 6 damage)
**Success Scaling:** 0 = miss, 1 = half damage (4), 2 = full damage (8), 3 = +8 damage (16 total), 4 = +16 damage (24 total)
**Scaling Option:** Can add Space 1 to affect 2 targets (total 4 Energy)
