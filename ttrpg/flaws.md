# Flaws

Flaws represent physical, mental, and social disadvantages that limit your character but grant points to purchase Traits. Choose flaws that create interesting roleplay opportunities and fit your character concept.

**Core Rules:**
- Flaws may only be taken during character creation
- Points from flaws can be spent on Traits
- You cannot spend more points on Traits than you have from Flaws
- Some flaws require GM approval
