# The Faith


## Design Notes

**Why These Energy Pairings?**

Each deity's energy pairing reflects their thematic focus:

- **Alkira:** Fire (his sunburst symbol, righteous flame) + Positive (protection, healing allies)
- **Ambis:** Positive (healing, nurturing) + Space (sanctuary, protective barriers)
- **Athore:** Positive (righteousness) + Fire (punishment, purification)
- **Enschede:** Time (prophecy, fate) + Space (scrying, divination)
- **Hirnaloyta:** Earth (nature, plants) + Positive (life, growth)
- **Nevil:** Negative (death, endings) + Time (cycles, passage)
- **Rudlu:** Space (illusion, trickery) + Air (freedom, unpredictability)
- **Shu-Jahan:** Space (learning, perception) + Positive (enlightenment, teaching)

**Channel Divinity Balance:**

Each deity has three options covering different aspects:
- One offensive/combat option
- One defensive/protective option  
- One utility/support option

This ensures versatility while maintaining deity flavor.

**Generalist Trade-off:**

The generalist gets:
- **Benefits:** More balanced energy distribution, access to all 8 deities' abilities (one each), ultimate versatility
- **Drawbacks:** Lower individual energy bonuses (+1/+1/+1 vs +2/+1), less specialized, weaker at any one thing

This makes focused devotion stronger for specialists while allowing pantheon-wide priests to exist.

## Temples

The symbol of the Pantheon is an 8-pointed star that represents the eight different gods that are acknowledged and worshipped throughout Estaea.  These are not individual gods with separate religions but a structure of gods forming a complete pantheon.
Most Villages and towns have a single building dedicated to the pantheon and not a single god. Larger cities may have a single temple dedicated to a particular deity, but that is not the norm. If they do however, they will also have a  primary temple with each "point" of the 8-pointed star dedicated to a different deity. The temples follow the same layout, with shrines dedicated to each god residing within each point.
Each deity does have a grand priest (or equivalent) and they are normally assigned to one of the Grand Temples. The Grand temples are scattered across Estaea.

## The Pantheon

The Pantheon consists of four male and four female deities. The people of Estaea will offer up a prayer to whichever god oversees the actions they are undertaking. 
People may choose a Patron god; one who they focus their worship upon in most things or who they wish to please in their daily lives. 

### Creation of the Eight

At the dawn of the world there were not eight gods--rather there was a singular omnipotent, all-encompassing god. As this primordial deity began to dream of creation, they saw that eight was a holy number, and so they began to plan and then to split. 
The Great One first divided into the two constants of the universe: death and fate. These two yin-and-yang deities called themselves Nevil and Enschede. The two existed alone together for a fraction of a second, but within that time it is believed that they witnessed the rise and fall of life a thousand times over.

The Enschede lineage evolved into three more after this: luck, wisdom, and justice became the moving pieces of fate. The gods Rudlu, Shu-Jahan, and Athore thus became the champions of fate and, with the Matron Enschede, composed half of Estaea’s pantheon.
The Nevil lineage, likewise, diverged and developed three more deities. Order, nature, and fertility became the components of the cycle of life and death that one saw in the world. The Patron Nevil and his emissaries Alkira, Ambis, and Hirnaloyta thus completed the pantheon and the holy eight powers of the universe.

It is important to note that Enschede’s and Nevil’s powers were not diminished after this division, but they are also no stronger or more important than their “children” (if that is what they can be called). Despite only existing independently of the rest of the pantheon for a millisecond, though, they are far more ancient than the other six.

One only has to look at mosaics of the Matron and Patron or glance upon their black-robed and blank-masked acolytes to understand that there is a decidedly distant, other factor about them. Their influence may be easier to overlook than the dynamic action of Alkira or Rudlu, but they are as steady and undeniable as a river shaping a canyon.

#### Small gods

Some rural or less civilized folk worship what are called Small Gods. Often these are daemons that have become associated with forested areas, deep pools of water, or other remote areas where a daemon may call home on the prime material.
Many are common daemons such as fey, keres, or elementals but people may still treat these outsiders with reverence. The Priests of the pantheon attempt to educate people in these matters, but many small faiths exist around these daemons. 

### Alkira

**God of Warriors and Order**

The god Alkira is the defender of the pantheon. This does not often manifest as infighting with any of the other deities, as the pantheon operates much like a family with aligned interests--that interest being the protection and prosperity of mortals.
The issue he does have within the pantheon falls between him and Rudlu, understandably, as the forces of order and chaos are fundamentally opposed. Despite this, most of Alkira’s energies are focused upon the daemonic forces outside of the Eight that would threaten their creation.

While Alkira is a fatherly presence to man and pantheon alike, his enemies find him to be a truly horrific force.

The tenant of Alkira is that all life is precious. This may appear at odds for the god of war, but his teachings temper the call for war. Alkira is also the God of order and demands obedience from his followers. 

The dual nature of Alkira is that all life has value, and it is most important that the warriors of the land show respect. Death is not the goal of war – the goal of war is to restore order. 

When war is necessary, Alkira directs that death and casualties should be minimized. Alkira is worshipped by many warriors. Any follower who dies in battle is guaranteed salvation by Alkira.

Alkira’s chosen day is known as the Rising of the Ruby and falls on the summer solstice.  Sacrifices of precious metals and gems are required.

Iconography of fire and Alkira’s sunburst are prolific on this day: the sky is filled with fireworks, and the streets are lined with mirrors reflecting light and braziers burning offerings.

From sunrise until the moment the sun reaches its zenith, it is a day of festivities and carnivals; as the afternoon approaches, the mood grows more serious.

Families are expected to gather and show gratitude toward the soldiers and warriors who fell within the last year. The smoke and sunbeams that fill the air at this time are believed to be the spirits of the fallen ascending to Alkira’s side.

High priests of Alkira perform rituals and services in decorative, but functional, suits of armor.  Tests of skill in combat are expected by both Alkira and his priests.  

Alkira is claimed to wield the sword Dawnbrearker. Engraved upon it is the phrase, “Do not unsheathe me without Wisdom. Do not wield me without Honor.” 

Bellicosian Priests practice a very fanatical form of worship of Alkira known as Ja'Alkira. While most devout people worship the whole pantheon, Bellicosians focus only upon the God Alkira.

### Ambis

**The Mother**

While Enschede may be the Matron of the pantheon, Ambis is undoubtedly the Mother of it and the world. Her motherly ways--both loving and fiercely protective—have led to her being one of the most widely worshipped deities in Estaea.
She is believed to take on the role of wife of Alkira, serving as the head of home and a healer while her husband is away at war. Caring, yet stern. Ambis is envisioned as a handsome mature woman with dark hair and dark eyes
On the final Jahanday of Lontaber, Ambis’s Festival of the Sown Hearth is held. Believed to be the most blessed of days due to the alignment of eights, the day is dedicated to the mother goddess in hopes that she will dole out blessings to those that praise her.
It is a joyful day full of goodwill and festivities where people decorate the doorways of their home with ribbons to attract certain blessings: purple to signify fertility, white for protection of the elderly, and green for wealth and prosperity.
Many rites of fertility have been developed by those who worship her, and the most sought-after midwives are those who follow Ambis. She is the patron of many nunneries and orphanages throughout Estaea
Ambis’s temples serve as a refuge and respite, a physical manifestation of the feeling one has when sheltering in the arms of their mother. Because of this, her places of worship are far from stereotypical churches. Instead they are orphanages, halfway homes, and other places where one can experience Ambis’s love firsthand.
The largest of these is the temple in Coudassis. Going by the name of Solace, the massive temple serves all the domestic needs of the people. One can just as easily find a warm meal or childcare there as they could find the typical prayer or funeral service of a temple.

**Symbol:** Chalice

### Athore

**God of Justice**

The most rigid and righteous of the gods, Athore represents all that is lawful and good in the world. He is the most ferocious opponent of chaos in every sense of the word; the hammer he carries doubles as both a gavel and a grave weapon against forces of evil.
Athore is envisioned as a large, robed, Dwarven male.  He is grayed and wrinkled with age and thought.  His right hand is that of logic and his left is justice. 
He is the judge and juror of both the Gods and mankind.  His actions are never to be spurned or questioned.   Stories abound of the justice that Athore has dealt to both mortals and immortals, but none is so famous as his dealing with the Dwarven King Derhagar.
Because of his fundamentally unyielding nature, Athore has experienced the most disagreement within the Eight. He finds issue with the neutrally aligned gods for he sees them to be spineless and passive, and his arguments with Rudlu have resulted in earthquakes and storms for the world below as the god of law and the goddess of trickery shouted at one another.
Athore’s holiday is a twofold event: the melancholy Dawn of Atonement, followed by the Eve of Righteousness. Beginning with the sunrise on the autumn solstice, people are expected to spend the morning contemplating their shortcomings of the last year.
After noon and into the evening, the pensiveness of the morning is left behind and a more honorable, just atmosphere is taken up. After acknowledging and atoning for failures through prayer and offerings, one is to commit to being better.
The evening is full of events of charity and fairness as folks model their behavior after the principles of Athore. Many trials are held on the Eve of Righteousness as well, for it is seen as an auspicious and clear-headed time to deliver justice.
The largest of Athore’s temples is found on an island in the middle of the Lake known as Athore’s foot. As the site of where Athore’s boot crushed King Derhagar after the dwarven armies slaughtered the elves out of greed and jealousy, the atmosphere of the temple is understandably sober.
It serves as a place of forgiveness, where one can come to confess and repent; it serves also as a place of retribution, where trials are carried out and executions are delivered. Were it not built with an open stone courtyard that is washed with the tides every night, the temple would likely be a bit more bloodstained than it currently is.

### Enschede

**Goddess of Fate**

In comparison to the rest of the Eight, Enschede is one of the more impartial deities. She, along with her “descendants” Rudlu and Athore, still care for the world, of course, but in many ways, it is more out of interest or sense of duty than it is out of pure love.
Given their domains, this makes sense. None of them could truly, effectively do their job if they were smitten with mortality. This has led to the occasional clashing between Enschede and Ambis in particular, but it has never tipped over into the scale of legitimate conflict.
The goddess of fate is depicted as a female with dark hair and a slender build.  She has no facial features, only a flat, unemotional, gray surface where her face should be.
Fate shows no partiality and Enschede does not associate with the other gods.  She knows all that is to come and is often believed to be in a permanent state of melancholia. 
The divination of fortunes or the future can be obtained through Enschede, but she does not recommend that mortals ask for such information.  The people of Echartesh forbid the divination of fortunes for this reason. 
Priests and Priestesses of Enchede on the continent of Estaea typically wear featureless masks. 
While many of the holidays of other deities are celebrations borne out of admiration or love, Enschede’s day Kismet Calling is one of pure obligation. There are no festivals or festivities or feasts, only the dutiful observation of the thousand-eyed mistress of fate.
Sacrifices of silver and practical things, like compasses or craftsmen tools, are made; Enschede does not demand massive amounts of wealth or glory to be given, but instead asks for commonplace things as a reminder that the power of fate touches even the most humble of things in life.
Enschede’s largest temple is called the Convergent Edge and is found in a deep gorge of Echartea. It is located in the gorge because the location is believed to be the site where ley lines and borders betweens the planes converge, allowing one to more easily scry or divine the future. Enschede’s acolytes thus serve as warrior-priests to guard the location from those who would take advantage of the taboo magics.

### Hirnaloyta

**Goddess of Nature**

The goddess Hirnaloyta represents all things natural and beautiful in the world, from the smallest ant to the most noble mountaintop. Hirnaloyta herself is thus often perceived by mortals as the most lovely of the Eight.
Hirnaloyta is described as a copper skinned Elven female who loves all living things, except those who destroy or defile her wards. She, along with her dearest companion Ambis, are seen as the caretakers of the pantheon.
Whereas Ambis represents domestic, familial safekeeping, Hirnaloyta stands for the wild and unpredictable yet genuine care of the natural world. She is also the creator goddess of the elves and holds a particular fondness for them in return.
The Dwarven King Derhagar created a mortal enemy in Hirnaloyta by his actions against the Elven empire.  Hirnaloyta personally sought Athore’s justice against Derhagar for his destruction.
At the beginning of the growing season, Hirnaloyta is invoked with the holiday of Harvest’s Helm. While the goddess is more commonly celebrated as the matron of wild things, she is also admired as the ruler of agriculture and civilized nature.
On Harvest’s Helm, Hirnaloyta is implored for a fruitful growing season by sacrificing the remainder of last year’s stores. While most folks do not offer the entire surplus, the greater the percentage that one gives is seen as a sign of greater faith.
Llewellyn Wood is Hirnaloyta’s gift to her disciples.  Llewelyn Wood, which means heart of nature, originated from a natural temple, a great tree, at the heart of where the Elves once lived.
Hirnaloyta taught her most devout followers the magic needed to harvest the precious wood and the secrets to its growth and life. 
Llewelyn wood is the most precious belonging to any elf and Hirnaloyta personally oversees who is chosen to have a piece Llewellyn Wood
Within the borders of the Far Eastern Grasslands lies the elven city of Baelessaira. The goddess’s most sacred place of worship, called Hirnaloyta’s Promise, is found here.
The temple and city are artfully indistinguishable from its surroundings, with architecture and nature being seamlessly woven together as one. Being the final remaining elven architecture from the dwarven wars, Baelessaira is a sad echo of what it once was.
Hirnaloyta’s Promise is found at the heart of the city and is likely the reason Baelessaira has been sustained for so long: the vines connecting the temple to every other structure around it seem to pulse with a faint, supernatural glow, as if Hirnaloyta herself is keeping the spirit of the city alive.

### Nevil

**God of the Underworld**

The god Nevil is, unsurprisingly, not a well-loved character of the pantheon. Those that worship him often do so in a somewhat begrudging manner; no one rejoices in the god that holds the souls of their loved ones from them, yet no one dares transgress against him lest he retaliate at a lack of respect.
Nevil is not an evil god but he holds dominion over the dead and darkness.  His role is a necessary part of life and he works in conjunction with other gods to keep things in order.
What mortals do not want to realize is that a god with power over death also holds sway over life. Nevil, along with his descendants Alkira and Ambis, is actually one of the deities most fond of humanity, as he spends the most time out of any of the pantheon with their souls.
Nevil himself is not the claimer of the dead or their souls but his followers are. His followers serve him on earth by helping the sick and wounded, and by claiming the souls of the dead.  Each new moon a priest is expected to give his claimed souls to Nevil.
Whereas Alkira’s festival, the Rising of the Ruby, joyously celebrates the souls of warriors who have passed from this world unto the next, Nevil’s Day of the Departed is a day of mourning. It is a subdued and humble recognition that Nevil’s power will claim all souls in the end.
While the atmosphere is austere, the food is not: the Day of the Departed, though by no means a celebration, is a day of generous feasts. Families are expected to open their doors to neighbors and beggars alike so that they may join them in both remembering the year’s dead and appreciating the next year of life they have been granted.
The chosen temple of Nevil is a bleak inversion of Hirnaloyta’s lush center. It was once referred to as the Garden of Souls, located in the swampy birch and reed forests of the Fens, but Nevil’s acolytes let it fall to disuse after a particularly bad season of flooding and storm. People have since taken to calling it the Bone Garden as a nod to both the eerie white trees surrounding it and to the deathly nature of the god himself
The priests of Nevil oversee all funeral ceremonies throughout the land. Most are largely the same, as all the cultures worship the same 8 gods. The final resting place, prayers, and ceremonies differ depending upon which God’s favor the deceased wishes to invoke.
The black robed High Priests of Nevil, with their Black skull masks, ride silently upon their elegant white steeds. 4 of them ride in procession ahead and behind the bier that the deceased is bourn upon.
The Silent Brothers of Nevil, in their gray robes and masks, make up the majority of the procession, but there are also the children and acolytes of Nevil in their white diaphanous robes and streamers that move throughout the crowd and the procession, symbolizing the spirits of the deceased welcoming their new member.

### Rudlu

**Goddess of Luck**

Lady Luck, Mistress of Fortune and Misfortune alike, and the Maiden of Foxes--all are titles that the trickster goddess Rudlu answers to. She is often depicted as an impish-faced young woman, smiling and frolicking with children and small animals.
Of all the pantheon, she has the most childlike nature: active and playful, albeit somewhat fickle and prone to squabbling. This squabbling is typically directed at Athore and Alkira as they are most at odds with her unorthodox approach to dealings with mortals.
The relaxed, unstructured nature of Rudlu is reflected in the fact that Rudlu alone lacks an official day of praise. Instead, festivals for her are held at various times of the year based on region and custom.
The Echartean humans, for example, celebrate her with a week-long festival in the dark of winter, full of fun and games and gambling.
The elves, by contrast, worship her on the spring equinox with a somber event called Fortune’s Bounty. On this day, one is to reflect on the good fortune they’ve had in the last year by giving a precious possession of theirs away to a loved one.
Unsurprisingly, worship of Rudlu is anything but organized. She boasts no dedicated temples outside of the standard eight-pointed ones that give praise to all the pantheon.
Instead, the closest the goddess of luck gets to a Grand Temple is the megalithic gambling den of Fortune’s Gambit within the Coudassian capital of Alqasar Gurdiana. Far be it from the casino to host services or homilies, its patrons still invoke Rudlu’s name as often as a true temple-goer might call upon Ambis or Athore.
Her symbol is emblazoned upon nearly all of Fortune Gambit’s doorways and poker tables, beckoning its patrons to try their luck one more time and play one more game.

**Symbol:** twelve-pointed star made of isosceles triangles


### Shu-Jahan

**God of Wisdom**

Along with Ambis, Shu-Jahan is the most widely and well-loved of the Holy Eight. He represents the path to true awareness and enlightenment, and he is courted by gods and mortals alike as such.
Truly a benevolent, forgiving, and patient God, Shu-Jahan is very selective in his followers.  True wisdom is what he looks for. Shu-Jahan will select his followers, they will not select him.
In the squabbling and infighting of the pantheon, Shu-Jahan is nearly always the voice that casts the final vote or brokers eventual peace. He is also, aside from Rudlu, one of the gods most active in the matters of the world below.
He is vocal in his approval (or disapproval) of how his temple and followers navigate the world, and though he is incredibly kind and understanding, he also understands how powerful a teacher of wisdom that humility can be.
Patience and time are two of the main teachings of Shu-Jahan and the lessons of eternity are hard learned. Monasteries are the perfect setting for the worship of Shu-Jahan, for immersion is the only true way to find his teachings.
Shu-Jahan is celebrated most widely during the Week of the Waters. Folks flock to coastlines and blessed reflection pools, gathering in groups ranging anywhere from a handful of people to hundreds. Such gathering marks the beginning of a week of philosophy and debate, community, and healing.
Everyone ends the eighth day richer than they began it, though this never entails human wealth. The spirit of Shu-Jahan moves freely in this time, granting inspiration and breakthrough to some followers and miracles of blessed healing to other 
The Grand Temple of Shu-Jahan is found in in the Lockabier Peaks, throughout a lush mountain range that features almost supernaturally clear waters. Called the Monks of the Six Springs, the monastery is spread both aboveground and below, inside stone and crystal-laced caverns.
The six major locations of the temple are all found built around a reflection pool, which are meant to inspire contemplation and the expansion outside of oneself.
Priests of Shu-jahan are encouraged to travel and explore as they grow in their faith. Some serve Shu-Jahan within the confines of scrolls and texts, but there is a demand to have the experiences to fill those volumes.
The priests, often warrior priests, are elevated above the rank of the Initiates and acolytes. They are free from the constraints of the formal church clergy and are viewed as missionaries. The priest’s schedule is their own, but ideally they would look to help the temple in any area they are in.
Shu-Jahan sees those that first come to him as blind and robes them in black. They cannot understand the differences that make up the greater things in this world.
As the followers grow, they begin to focus on areas of learning. Often this will involve sending a priest to a particular temple or shrine for their discoveries. As the follower climbs in understanding, their vestments also change. It is easy to recognize members of rank by their distinctive colored robes.

| Color | Level |
|-------|-------|
| Black | Initiates. 0 level |
| Red | 1-3 |
| Orange | 4-7 |
| Yellow | 8-12 |
| Green | 13-16 |
| Blue | 17-18 |
| Indigo | 19 |
| Violet | 20 |
| White | Church Head |

Shu-Jahan is one of the largest monastic orders. The monks and priests of shu-Jahan look for wisdom in all things in attempts to unravel the mysteries of the universe.
They are humble and agreeable, never boastful in their knowledge. Many priests of shu-Jahan find their way into the councils of leaders great and small. Wisdom does not deny the use of force, and the temples of Shu-Jahan do produce several warrior priests and monks alike.
The warriors of Shu-Jahan progress through trials to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of the world around them. Knowing when to use force is as important as when to use restraint. Warriors of different ranks are identified by colored tunics or tabards.

## The Order of Eight

### Dragon Cult
The order of eight is an ancient and presumably obsolete religion revolving around the great Daemons of legends known as Dragons.
Dragons are thought to be extinct if they ever existed to begin with. The order of eight was a monastical religion with very fanatical tendencies. There were eight dragons and they are:  Aq-Yin-To, Char-Talt, Har-Ten-Mo, Kylo, Luk-Anda, Sein-Tuk-Tak,Tiet-Amor, Garro-Leth

**Symbol:** Eight colored discs on a convoluted frame. 


## Avatars of the Eight

Perceived as the embodiment of the Gods, the Avatars of the Eight act as impartial mediators of the land.
Their verdict can overturn local law and opposing a ruling can result in the fervor of the masses and the Mob.
Only seven avatars walk the land at any one time. An avatar of the eight is easily recognizable as they are always surrounded by a nimbus of magical light. Their movements seem slowed as well, as if they are moving through water or some other substance, and even their hair seems to flow and float as if suspended within the nimbus surrounding them. They walk at what appears to be a normal pace but their stride would match the walking pace of a horse.
Avatars are reawakened every eight years. The reborn avatar awakes in the morning, clothed in the skin of the host they now inhabit. It is said that all the lives that an Avatar has been born to are remembered but are not tethers to the avatars when they are reborn.
