# Mechanics of the Magical world
Although much of what is contained below would be considered forgotten knowledge to the current inhabitants of Athelu, it is necessary to understand how Magic, the External Planes, and outsiders interact within the game world.
There are some terms that might need to be clarified for those unfamiliar with them, whether they are common to other Role-playing games or not.
It is possible that the usage of these terms within the world of Legends of Athelu™ is not the same as what you have encountered in other systems.
The cosmology of this campaign setting is similar to that of many traditional game systems albeit with some changes that justify declaring the differences. 

## Prime Material Plane

The prime material plane is what we would consider the physical realm. The plane of existence where the physical world is located. It is typically seen as the "default" plane of existence and is the plane where most of the action takes place. In this plane, the laws of physics as we know them apply, and the world is populated by mortals, animals, and other creatures. It constitutes the physical universe as we know it, which includes the entire physical world of the planet of Athelu.

## External Planes

The external planes are the outside forces that influence the prime material. These are the elemental planes of fire, air, earth, and water, as well as the overlapping planes of shadow and ethereal and the positive and negative planes.
These planes exist just beyond the physical realm and travel to and between them requires magic and great expertise.
It is from these planes that the gods reached to draw forth the raw materials needed to create the prime material plane. 
This condensed cosmology consolidates many of the traditional planes. 

## Ethereal Plane

The Ethereal Plane is a mystical, otherworldly realm that exists parallel to the Prime Material Plane and is home to a variety of beings and phenomena. It is a place of swirling mists and dimly lit landscapes, where the physical laws of the material world do not always apply.
The Ethereal Plane is typically only accessible through magic, such as the spell Etherealness, and is often used as a means of transportation or escape by skilled spellcasters. While on the Ethereal Plane, travelers can see into the material world, but they are invisible and intangible to those on the material plane.
It is a place of great mystery and potential danger, as travelers must navigate its strange terrain and be wary of the beings that dwell within it.

## Shadow Plane

The Shadow Plane, also known as the Plane of Shadow or Shadowfell, is a parallel dimension that is both similar and different from the Material Plane. It is a dark and eerie reflection of the Material Plane, with its features distorted and twisted. The Shadow Plane is a place of darkness and shadow, where light is dimmed, and colors are muted.
In the Shadow Plane, the boundaries between the living and the dead are blurred, and the shadowy spirits of the departed roam free. The Shadow Plane is also home to a variety of strange and dangerous creatures, many of which are native to this dark realm. These include shadow beasts, dark fey, and undead creatures. The landscape of the Shadow Plane is varied, ranging from desolate wastelands to twisted forests and dark, haunted cities.
Travel to the Shadow Plane is difficult and dangerous, and most mortals who venture there do so only at great risk to their lives and souls. 

## The Elemental Planes

The Elemental Planes are a group of planes consisting of four main planes: the Plane of Air, the Plane of Earth, the Plane of Fire, and the Plane of Water. These planes are the purest expressions of their respective elemental energies and are home to a variety of powerful elemental creatures and phenomena.
• **The Plane of Air** is an endless expanse of winds and storms, with vast open skies and powerful winds that can easily sweep travelers off their feet. It is home to creatures such as air elementals, djinn, and flying beasts like griffins and hippogriffs.
• **The Plane of Earth** is a vast underground network of caverns, tunnels, and subterranean landscapes. It is home to creatures such as earth elementals, xorn, and burrowing beasts like bulettes and ankhegs.
• **The Plane of Fire** is an infernal realm of searing heat and flame, where rivers of lava and geysers of fire spew forth from the ground. It is home to creatures such as fire elementals and efreeti.
• **The Plane of Water** is a vast, endless ocean, with towering waves, deep trenches, and hidden coves. It is home to creatures such as water elementals, merfolk, and aquatic beasts like giant squid and kraken.
Each of the Elemental Planes has its own unique ecology and dangers, and adventurers who venture to these planes must be prepared to face the challenges and perils that await them.

## The Faewild

The Faewild, also known as the Feywild, exists within the elemental planes in the setting of Legends of Athelu. The fae have spread far and wide, with many courts established on the different elemental planes. It is a realm of faeries, fey creatures, and other magical beings;  a place of paradoxes, where time can be fluid and seasons can change in a heartbeat. The landscape is beautiful and strange, with towering trees, crystal clear lakes, and rolling hills, but also filled with hidden dangers and tricks.
The inhabitants of the Faewild are as varied as the landscape itself, ranging from tiny sprites and pixies to powerful archfey and lords and ladies of the courts. These beings are often unpredictable and capricious, and they are known to toy with mortals who venture into their realm.

The Faewild is often viewed as a place of escape and adventure, a land where anything is possible and the impossible is commonplace. However, it is also a place of danger, where mortals who stay too long can become lost or trapped, and where the boundaries between reality and fantasy can become blurred. 

## The Positive Plane
The Positive Plane is a realm of pure life energy and vitality, a place where positive energy flows freely and unencumbered. It is a place of intense light and warmth, and those who are sensitive to it describe it as a place of pure joy and ecstasy. The positive energy of the plane is believed to be the source of all life in the multiverse, and it is said that the deities themselves draw power from this plane. It is also home to a number of powerful celestial beings, such as angels and archons, who serve as its guardians and emissaries. However, the intense energy of the positive plane can be dangerous to those who are not properly attuned to it, and exposure to it can lead to death or even transformation into a creature of pure energy. Within the setting of Legends of Athelu, the positive plane also contains the upper planes (Arcadia, Mount Celestia, Bytopia, Elysium, The beastlands, Arborea, and Ysgard)

## The Negative Plane

It is a plane of pure darkness, coldness, and lifelessness, composed entirely of negative energy. This energy is the opposite of the positive energy that animates living creatures, and it drains life force from any living beings that enter the plane.
The Negative Energy Plane is inhospitable to most forms of life, but some creatures have adapted to its harsh environment. Travel to the Negative Energy Plane can be dangerous, as prolonged exposure to its negative energy can drain the life force of living beings and even kill them. Within the setting of Legends of Athelu, the negative Plane contains the lower planes as well (Acheron, The Nine Hells, Ghenna, Hades, Carceri, The Abyss and Pandemonium).

## Out of Sync Planes 

The Planes of Limbo and Mechanus are additional overlapping planes with the prime material, but are out of phase with the other planes, which prevents travel to or from them, and therefore they are not part of the known cosmology of Athelu. 
These planes are where Athore banished the dwarves and the end of the war. Unable to destroy his creations, he instead trapped them here, cut off from the rest of the universe. 

# Ley Lines

Lines of power crisscross the surface of the planet created by the intersections of the eight external planes with the material world. Each of these planes slices cleanly through the world, creating tension in these places where the barrier between the material world and the external plane touch.
Ley lines are invisible to the naked and untrained eye, but their location can often be discovered through studying local folklore or legends.
Ley lines themselves are nascent but can be used to augment magics related to the plane they represent. Extensive use of these related magics while in proximity to the Ley Line will result in what is called "Ley Line Affinity".
Once affinity has been achieved, the magic user can see the course of the Ley Line with the use of Detect Magic.

## Nexus

A nexus is where two or more Ley lines intersect the material plane. Nexus are broken into classes based upon the number of Ley Lines present: Class A nexus have four ley lines present; Class B nexus have three Ley Lines present, and Class C nexus have two Ley Lines present.
Nexus points are visible to anyone, manifesting themselves as a near blinding sphere of magical light. Overall size and brightness of the light varies by class. The ley lines themselves are also visible for a short distance from a nexus point. How far away they may be observed is based upon the class of Nexus.
Nexus rarely occur at ground level; most nexus points are found beneath the surface of the planet, or in other equally remote and inhospitable locations.
A magic user that accesses the energy at a nexus point will gain an affinity to the Ley line present at that Nexus point automatically.

## Planar Travel

Interplanar travel (travel to one of the external planes) is easier when done at a ley line or nexus point. The barriers between the prime material and the corresponding external plane are weak in these places. 
A magic user can leverage the ley lines or nexus for an extraplanar jaunt as well - allowing them to step out upon any point where the ley line intersects the prime material.
This type of travel is exceedingly dangerous without extensive preparation or knowledge. 

# Daemon

Daemon is the term ascribed to any non-native being inhabiting the prime material plane. This covers a wide variety of beings, both benevolent and malign.
The taxonomical requirement for classification as a Daemon is that the creature is sustained by magical energy; they consume it just as a creature of the prime material requires air, food, and water.
Some Daemons have been documented eating and drinking but this is for pleasure and not out of a requirement for it as sustenance.
This classification therefore extends to magical creatures such as aberrations and monstrosities. Outside of these accidentally or intentionally created creatures, Daemons are often further classified by their plane of origin.
The physical characteristics of a Daemon rarely contribute to their classification, as the physical appearance a Daemon displays on the material plane may not be the same as on its native plane of existence. Many Daemons also have no fixed form and can assume any appearance at will.
Deamons on the prime material are the source of all folklore and legends. The local populace recognize the magical nature of daemons and will often treat them with reverence by leaving out food or other gifts. 
Daemons can be broken down into the following creature types:

• Aberrations
• Drakes
• Elementals
• Fae
• Therianthropes
• Monstrosities
• Nephilim
• Oozes
• Outsiders
• Undead

## Aberrations

Aberrations are creatures that are not of this world or plane, and their appearance and abilities often defy logic and reality as we know it. They are typically considered to be strange, monstrous, or unnatural, and they may possess bizarre abilities or physical traits that set them apart from more mundane creatures. Aberrations can range in size from small, unassuming creatures to massive, terrifying beasts, and they may live in a variety of environments, including underground caverns, and deep oceans; essentially whatever environment most closely resembles that of their origin. 

## Drakes

Drakes are spawn of the Great Dragon Daemons of Legend. There are two categories – Lesser Drakes, and Greater Drakes. 
Greater drakes would be represented by the chromatic dragons found within published works, with the exception that they can shapeshift like their metallic counterparts.  If they were present on the world of Athelu they would spend their time in a humanoid disguise to further their plans. Lesser Drakes are powerful reptilian creatures, similar in appearance to dragons but smaller and less intelligent. They have four limbs, a long tail, but no wings. Drakes come in many different colors, from green to red to blue to black, and each color is associated with a different type of breath weapon that the drake can use in combat.
Drakes are known for their incredible strength and resilience, as well as their fierce loyalty to their chosen rider or master. They are often used as mounts by Greater Drakes. 

## Elemental

Elementals are beings of pure elemental energy, embodying the fundamental building blocks of existence. They are typically associated with the classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water, although there are many other types of elementals that are associated with other forms of energy or matter. Elementals are usually formed from the essence of their respective element and possess unique abilities and characteristics based on their elemental nature.
Elementals can be found in various forms and sizes, ranging from tiny, wispy creatures to massive, towering behemoths. They are usually highly resistant or immune to their respective element, and they possess the ability to manipulate and control it with great precision. Elementals are often summoned by powerful magic users or priests to perform specific tasks, and they can be commanded to do their master's bidding. However, they are not typically known for their intelligence or independence, and they usually lack the capacity for complex thought or decision making beyond their programming or directives. They cannot normally remain upon the material plane unless they find a location like the conditions of their home plane. Elementals are territorial, but largely ambivalent to their surroundings. Their inherently selfish nature can often be used against them, making them unwitting guardians on someone else's behalf.

## Fae

Fae, also known as faeries or fairies, are mythical beings often depicted as small, supernatural creatures with magical powers. They are often associated with nature and the elements, and are said to live in otherworldly realms such as forests, meadows, and mountains.
Fae are typically portrayed as mischievous and playful, but can also be capricious and dangerous. They are known to interact with humans, sometimes offering assistance or granting wishes, but often with a catch or trick involved. Some fae are said to be benevolent, while others are malevolent.
There are many different types of fae, each with their own unique traits and characteristics. Some of the most well-known types include pixies, sprites, nymphs, and leprechauns. In some cultures, fae are considered to be a type of spirit or deity and are worshiped or revered as such. 
Pure Fae are largely harmless if a bit mischievous.  Pure Fae would be represented by any of the Neutral or Chaotic Fey from any published sources. 
Like all Daemons however, if a Fae manifests on Athelu at a nexus, they can become altered. The resulting state depends upon the nexus, but the most concerning are those near the Negative Energy ley lines. 
This results in a corrupted Fae which would be represented by any of the Evil fey found within published sources. 

## Therianthropes

Therianthropes are humanoid creatures that can transform into animals or animal-like creatures, typically wolves, but sometimes bears, boars, tigers, or other predatory animals. They are often portrayed as cursed individuals, who transform involuntarily under certain conditions, such as during a full moon, or when they are filled with intense emotions like anger or fear. In some stories, they are able to control their transformations and even use their abilities for good, such as protecting their communities or fighting against evil. Therianthropes are often depicted as having enhanced physical abilities, such as strength and speed, and a heightened sense of smell and hearing in their animal form. These poor cursed souls do exist on Athelu, and trace their heritage back to daemons cursed ancestors. 

## Monstrosities

Monstrosities are creatures that are often unnatural or bizarre in appearance, defying simple categorization as beasts, humanoids, or other common creature types. They may be the result of magical experimentation, natural aberrations, or mutations caused by exposure to strange energies or substances. Monstrosities come in a wide variety of forms and sizes, ranging from giant, tentacled beasts to small, misshapen creatures with unsettling abilities. While some monstrosities may be hostile and dangerous to humans and other creatures, others are docile or even helpful, serving as valuable allies or sources of rare materials or abilities. Examples of monstrosities include chimeras, manticores, and griffins.
Monstrosities be found on Athelu but are very rare. These creatures are often the focus of local folklore or legend and considered more myth than reality. They would not be found as pets, mounts, or attractions, and skeletons of such creatures, or other trophies, would often be fake. 

## Nephilim

Nephilim are daemons from the elemental planes. Unlike regular elementals, they manifest on Athelu as Giant Humanoids due to the interaction of a Nexus. 
Like their pure elemental brethren, they will only manifest in areas conducive to their survival. Any of the Giant types can be found, but they are predominantly reclusive and would never be found near permanent human or elven settlements. 

## Oozes

Oozes are amorphous, gelatinous creatures that are generally classified as mindless and predatory. Oozes are usually found in subterranean environments such as dungeons, caves, and sewers, where they consume anything organic that comes their way.
Oozes come in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small puddles of slime to massive, tentacled masses that can fill entire rooms. They are typically immune to many types of attacks, including those that target the mind or the nervous system. In addition, oozes are often resistant to acid and other forms of elemental damage, and they may be able to regenerate lost body parts. Oozes can be created by magic or just be the physical manifestation of some lesser daemon on the prime material.

## Outsiders

Outsiders are deamons from the non-elemental planes. Outsiders can be classified into different categories based on their alignment, physical form, and powers. Some common types of outsiders include:
Celestials: These are typically beings of good alignment that hail from the positive plane. They are often associated with virtues such as courage, compassion, and justice.
Fiends: These are typically beings of evil alignment that come from the negative Plane. They are often associated with traits such as cruelty, deception, and corruption.
Outsider Beings: These are entities that do not fit into the other categories of outsiders. They can be humanoid, animalistic, or even amorphous in form.
Outsiders are often seen as powerful and enigmatic creatures, and their motives and goals may be difficult for mortals to understand.  They are viewed with both reverence and fear, and their interactions with the mortal world can have profound consequences. 

## Undead

Undead do exist within the world of Athelu, but they are not like ordinary undead. They manifest from the souls (Pneuma) of particularly wicked individuals. This is the case for most undead in fantasy games but is not normally significant to their role in the game. It is paramount of concern for the world of Athelu.
An undead creature would most likely manifest along a Ley line of Negative Energy. This Ley line would feed the creature and cause it to become much more powerful than a typical undead of its type. 
As long as the undead creature is within the vicinity of the Ley line, it will also continue to heal if hurt. Even non-intelligent undead will realize the advantage of staying near a Ley line. 

# Crossover

Crossover is defined as the process by which a Daemon comes to the material plane. Folktales tell of magical beings appearing out of thin air or remote areas home to powerful outsiders.
Daemons, however attracted or lured, are unable to crossover without aid from someone on the material plane. This aid need not only come from a magic user; the mastery of the arcane or divine is not the only thing that allows this barrier to be broken.

# Pneuma

The soul, as it is called by the faithful, is the connection to the divinities. As the gods each were involved in the creation of men, each man has a piece of the divine within him. Pneuma is life, and contains one’s identity, thought, and being.
Of the creatures that were created by the divine, only man and elf can wield magic. Dwarves were denied pneuma when Athore chose to withhold magic from them. Without this spark, this connection to the divine, dwarven-kind was doomed. Without pneuma, dwarves we disconnected from the world, forever feeling out of place.
 Pneuma is magic. That spark, that will, that identity, is pure magical energy. Pneuma, as it is released, moves toward the barriers between the planes, typically a ley line or nexus. As it crosses the threshold between the material plane into the beyond, its magic calls to the daemons on the other side.
This small spark of life allows the daemons to crossover. If, at the right place, at the right time, the daemon can exchange places with the Pneuma. This explains the spontaneous creation and existence of minor daemons in the world such as the Fae, elementals, sprites, and even Keres or other spirits.
As pneuma is the identity and being of the person who died, it attracts qualities akin to it. It will travel to a nexus or ley line that is most closely aligned to it. The character of the deceased determines what type of Daemon could enter the world.
