**Size:** Medium
**HP:** 40 (Con 5 × 8)
**DR:** 0 (no armor)
**Speed:** 30 ft
**Attributes:** Str 4 / Con 5 / Agi 3 / Dex 3 / Int 2 / Wis 3 / Cha 2 / Luck 2
**Background:** Laborer
**Skills:** Might 2, Athletics 2, Constitution saves 1, Craft 1
**Senses:** Normal
**Creature Type:** Humanoid (no special immunities)
**Initiative Bonus:** +3 (Agi 3)
**Languages:** Common
- **Attacks:**
  - **Club [Combat]:** Melee attack (Agi 3 + Melee Combat 0), Reach: 5 ft
    - ***Margin 1***: 4 damage, Margin 2: 8 damage (4 + 4 Str)
- **Alternative Actions:**
  - **Grapple/Shove:** Str 4 + Athletics 2 (opposed by target's Str + Athletics)
    - On success, can grapple (restrain) or shove (knock prone or push 5 ft)

**Starting Feats:** None (0 feats - untrained civilian)
**Purchased Feats:** None (0 maximum at TR 1/4)

**Description:** Everyday working people - laborers, dockworkers, farmers in off-season, craftspeople, servants. No combat training whatsoever. Strong and hardy from physical work (hence Con 5) but completely inexperienced in fighting. When encountered, they're typically going about their business and want nothing to do with adventurers or violence. May be intimidated, bribed, or reasoned with easily. Form angry mobs only when pushed to desperation by tyranny or injustice. Loyal to their community but not suicidal.

**Tactics:** Commoners avoid combat whenever possible. If forced to fight, they use improvised weapons (clubs, tools, pitchforks) and rely on numbers. More likely to grapple, shove, or flee than engage in actual weapon combat. Will break and run if taking casualties. May fight to defend their homes/families but otherwise have no combat training or courage. In groups of 5+, may gain confidence and use mob tactics (surrounding, grappling to hold enemies for others to strike).

**Equipment:** Club (improvised weapon), work clothes, work gloves, work boots

**Variants:**
- **Farmer:** Replace Athletics 2 with Wilderness 2, use Farmer background (Wilderness 2, Might 2, Athletics 1, Craft 1)
- **Dock Worker:** Same stats, carries cargo hook instead of club (same damage)

  - **Shield Master** (Str 3, Melee 3, must use shield - 40 XP): Subtract 1 from both dice on Reflex saves while using a shield. 

**Description:** Local militia members called to defend their town or region. Part-time soldiers - farmers, craftsmen, merchants, and workers who train together regularly for local defense. More disciplined and organized than bandits but less professional than full-time soldiers. Loyal to their community and willing to defend it, though they may break and flee if facing overwhelming odds or supernatural threats. They know the local area well and can call for reinforcements from fellow militia or town guards.

**Tactics:** Militia members use defensive tactics, forming shield walls with Defensive Stance when outnumbered. They use spears to maintain reach, keeping enemies at bay while supporting each other. Shield Master allows them to negate one devastating attack per fight - typically saved for critical moments. They fight in coordinated groups when possible, using their numbers and defensive training to overcome individual skill gaps. Against ranged attackers, they advance in formation, shields raised.

**Equipment:** Spear, buckler, aketon armor, uniform, bedroll, high boots, common clothes

**Variants:**
- **Militia Archer:** Replace Melee Combat 3 with Ranged Combat 3, use shortbow instead of spear, replace Shield Master with Precise Shot

### Thug (Human)
**Threat Rating:** 1/2
**Size:** Medium
**HP:** 24 (Con 3 × 8)
**DR:** 0 (no armor)
**Speed:** 30 ft
**Attributes:** Str 3 / Con 3 / Agi 5 / Dex 4 / Int 2 / Wis 3 / Cha 2 / Luck 2
**Skills:** Stealth 3, Thievery 2, Deception 2, Intimidate 2, Melee Combat 3
**Background:** Criminal
**Senses:** Normal
**Initiative Bonus:** +5 (Agi 5)
**Creature Type:** Humanoid (no special immunities)
**Languages:** Common
- **Attacks:**
  - **Dagger [Combat]:** Melee attack (Agi 5 + Melee Combat 3), Reach: 5 ft
    - ***Margin 1:*** 4 damage
    - ***Margin 2:*** 9 damage (4 + 5 Agi)
  - **With Exploit Weakness:** When ally within 5 ft of target OR subtracting from attack dice, add Dex 4 to damage
    - ***Margin 1:*** 8 damage (4 + 4 Dex)
    - ***Margin 2:*** 13 damage (4 + 5 Agi + 4 Dex)
  - **Thrown** (Range 30/60 ft): Use Dex 4 + Ranged Combat 0
    - ***Margin 1:*** 4 damage
    - ***Margin 2:*** 9 damage (4 + 3 Str)

- **Feats:**
  - **Swift Movement** (Agi 4): Can Disengage or Hide using only 1 [Minor] action instead of a full action. Perfect for hit-and-run tactics.
  - **Danger Sense** (Wis 3): Subtract 1 from both dice on Reflex saves against effects you can see. Represents street-smart reflexes.
  - **Exploit Weakness** (Agi 4, Stealth or Thievery 3, 40 XP): Once per round, when attacking with an ally within 5 feet of target OR subtracting from attack dice (from any source), add Dexterity score (4) to damage.

**Description:** Street criminals - muggers, gang members, hired muscle for criminal organizations. More dangerous than commoners due to actual combat training (Melee 3) and willingness to use violence. Operate in rough neighborhoods, extorting shopkeepers, robbing travelers, collecting debts for loan sharks. Cowards at heart - fight dirty, gang up on isolated victims, flee when facing real danger. May be redeemed or may be irredeemably vicious depending on circumstances. Criminal background gives them underworld contacts for fencing stolen goods.

**Tactics:** Thugs rely on numbers and dirty fighting. They use Swift Movement to dart in, attack with allies nearby (triggering Exploit Weakness for +4 damage), then Disengage as a [Minor] action to avoid retaliation. Prefer ambushes from stealth (Stealth 3) and will flee if facing organized opposition or taking heavy damage. Use Intimidate 2 to cow victims into submission rather than fighting. Will throw daggers only when fleeing or unable to close to melee.
In groups of 3+, they surround enemies to constantly trigger Exploit Weakness. One thug distracts while others stab from behind. If one goes down, the rest typically flee unless led by someone more dangerous (like a gang leader or TR 1 Enforcer).

**Equipment:** Dagger, crowbar, common clothes, belt pouch, wool hood, low boots

**Variants:**
- **Pickpocket:** Raise Thievery 2→4 (20 XP), lower Melee Combat 3→2 (saves 12 XP), more focused on theft than combat, use Swift Movement to escape after stealing
- **Enforcer:** Use Mercenary background for better combat training, represents gang muscle who collects debts and intimidates
- **Burglar:** Raise Stealth 3→4 (24 XP), replace Danger Sense with Supreme Stealth feat when qualified at TR 2, focused on breaking and entering

  - **Danger Sense** (Wis 3): Subtract 1 from both dice on Reflex saves against effects you can see. Represents trained awareness.

  - **Shield Master** (Str 3, Melee 3, must use shield, 40 XP): Subtract 1 from both dice on Reflex saves while using shield. 

**With Heater Shield:** Gains Fortune on defensive melee rolls

**Description:** Professional city guards - trained, disciplined, paid soldiers who take their duty seriously. Unlike militia (part-timers) or thugs (criminals), these are career guardsmen with years of experience. They know the law, recognize troublemakers, and maintain order. Respect from citizens, feared by criminals. Will show mercy to those who surrender but are hardened enough to use lethal force when necessary. Loyal to their city and fellow guards - won't abandon posts or comrades easily.

**Tactics:** Town guards are professional soldiers who patrol cities and enforce laws. They use formation tactics, working in pairs or small groups. When facing threats, they use Defensive Stance to protect citizens while calling for backup. Against dangerous foes, they use Power Attack to end fights quickly before reinforcements arrive. The heater shield provides excellent defense against both melee (Fortune on defense rolls) and ranged attacks (force Misfortune on attackers).
Guards prioritize de-escalation and arrest over lethal force when possible, using Intimidate 3 to command compliance. They know the local area (Society 1) and can quickly summon help. Against multiple weak opponents, they hold defensive positions. Against single strong opponents, they use Power Attack aggressively while one guard runs for help.
Shield Master's once-per-combat negation is saved for critical moments - blocking a potentially fatal blow to themselves or buying time for civilians to escape.

**Equipment:** Longsword, heater shield, chain mail, uniform, manacles, work gloves, work boots

**Variants:**
- **Gate Guard:** Replace Intimidate 3 with Investigate 3, focused on spotting smugglers and checking papers
- **Archer Guard:** Replace Melee 4 with Ranged 4, use longbow instead of longsword, swap Power Attack for Precise Shot
- **Sergeant:** Add +1 Cha (becomes 3), can lead 4-6 guards effectively
