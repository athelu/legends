# Core System

### Core Mechanic: Roll Under

#### Basic Skill Test

1.  Roll d8 for the governing attribute
2.  Roll d8 for the skill
3.  Each die that rolls **under** its value = 1 success
4.  **Rolling a natural 1 always counts as a success** regardless of attribute/skill value
5.  **Rolling an 8 always fails** (counts as 0 successes)
6.  Maximum 2 successes per basic test

#### Success Thresholds
-   Easy Task: 1 success required
-   Hard Task: 2 successes required

### Advanced Rolling Mechanics

**Shared Attribute Roll:** When making multiple checks with the same attribute as part of a single action or simultaneous activity, roll the attribute die once. Each check uses this same attribute result but rolls its own skill die separately.

**Single Die Modifiers:** Some effects specify they modify only the "attribute die" or "skill die" rather than both. Unless a rule specifically states it affects only one die, all modifiers apply to both dice in a check.

**Examples:**
-   "Add 1 to both die results" - affects both attribute and skill dice
-   "Add 1 to the attribute die only" - only affects attribute die
-   "Reroll the skill die" - only affects skill die

### Fortune (bonus):
-   Roll 3d8 total (instead of the normal 2d8)
-   Take the best (lowest) 2 results
-   Assign one result to the attribute, one to the skill
-   Count successes normally
-   Represents favorable circumstances, superior positioning, or cosmic luck

### Misfortune (penalty):
-   Roll 3d8 total (instead of the normal 2d8)
-   Take the worst (highest) 2 results
-   Assign one result to the attribute, one to the skill
-   Count successes normally
-   Represents unfavorable circumstances, poor positioning, or cosmic ill luck

#### Example with Fortune:
-   Stealth check: Agility 4, Stealth 3
-   Roll 3d8: results are 2, 5, 7
-   Take best 2: 2 and 5
-   Assign: 2 to Agility (<4? Success!), 5 to Stealth (<3? Failure)
-   Total: 1 success

**Multiple sources:** Fortune and Misfortune cancel each other out on a 1-to-1 basis. If you have 2 sources of Fortune and 1 source of Misfortune, you have 1 Fortune remaining.

### Critical Success: Rolling double 1s
-   Both dice automatically succeed (counts as 2 successes)
-   Grants +1 additional success (total 3 successes in opposed rolls)
-   Restore all Luck points to maximum
-   **In combat:** 3+ success margin = maximum damage + Luck restore + apply condition

### Critical Failure: Rolling double 8s
-   Both dice automatically fail (0 successes)
-   Action fails catastrophically
-   GM determines consequences

### Opposed Rolls
-   Both participants roll their relevant attribute + skill
-   More successes wins
-   Tie goes to the defender (or lowest total rolled)

## The Luck System
### Luck Pool
-   Each session begins with Luck points equal to your Luck attribute
-   Current Luck depletes as you spend it throughout the session
-   Resets to full after a long rest/new session

### Spending Luck (Active Use)
-   Cost: 1 Luck point reduces any single die result by 1
-   Can spend multiple points on one roll

### Luck for Complications (Reactive)
When you achieve partial success (1 success when 2 needed):
1.  Roll d8
2.  If result is < your Current Luck: No complication
3.  If result is > your Current Luck: GM introduces a complication, cost, or consequence

### Luck in Saving Throws
All three saving throw types roll Attribute + Current Luck and count successes:
-   Fortitude Save: Constitution + Current Luck
-   Reflex Save: Agility + Current Luck
-   Willpower Save: Wisdom + Current Luck

Roll 2d8 (one for the attribute, one for Current Luck), count successes.
These successes are compared against the threat's successes.

**Important:** As you spend Luck throughout the session, your Current Luck decreases, making it harder to generate successes on your Luck die!

#### Example:
-   Early session with Current Luck 3: Roll Constitution d8 and Luck d8
    (need <3 on Luck die)
-   Late session with Current Luck 0: Roll Constitution d8 and Luck d8 (need 1 on Luck die as 1 = success)
-   Your Constitution can still generate successes, but Luck only on a 1

### Restoring Luck During Sessions

#### Short Rest (10 minutes):
-   Regain 1 Luck point
-   Cannot exceed maximum

#### GM Story Awards (1-2 Luck):
-   Heroic actions and epic roleplay
-   Clever solutions
-   Lucky breaks and fortuitous discoveries
-   Major story milestones
-   Defeating significant enemies

#### Critical Success Bonus:
-   Rolling double 1s restores ALL Luck points to maximum

#### Consumable Items (Optional):
-   Lucky charms and talismans can restore 1-3 Luck
-   Found as treasure or purchased from merchants

## Hit Point Recovery

### Short Rest (10 minutes)
-   Regain HP equal to Constitution attribute
-   Regain 1 Luck point
-   No limit on frequency (can be taken as often as needed)

### Long Rest (8 hours of sleep)
-   Regain HP equal to Constitution × 4
-   Restore all Luck points to maximum
-   Restore all Energy points to maximum
-   Remove certain conditions (GM discretion)

#### Example: A character with Constitution 4 (32 max HP):
-   Short rest: Regains 4 HP
-   Long rest: Regains 16 HP (half max HP)
-   Full recovery requires 2 long rests without magical healing

## Action Economy

### Actions Per Turn

Each character gets 3 actions per turn

#### Actions can be spent on:
-   Standard Actions (combat, weave, use item, skill check, etc.)
-   Move Actions (move up to your speed)
-   Minor Actions (draw weapon, open door, speak, etc.)

### Action Keywords
-   [Combat] - Offensive/tactical combat abilities
-   [Activate] - Using items or devices
-   [Interact] - Non-combat interactions and skills
-   [Move] - Movement and positioning
-   [Minor] - Quick, simple actions
-   [Free] - No action cost
-   [Reaction] - Triggered responses (don't use turn actions)

#### Minor Action Rule
-   One [Minor] action can be combined with a [Move] action for free
-   Examples: Draw weapon while moving, open door while moving

### Multiple Action Penalty

Only actions with [Combat] keywords trigger the penalty:
-   First [Combat] action: Normal
-   Second [Combat] action: Add 1 to both die results
-   Third [Combat] action: Add 2 to both die results

All other keyword types can be used multiple times without penalty.

## Experience and Advancement

### Experience Points (XP)
-   **24 XP per session** (awarded equally to all players)
-   XP can be spent on attributes, skills, Potentials (if magical), or feats

### Advancement Costs
-   **Skills:** 4 for rank 1, else 8 × current rank
-   **Attributes:** 16 × current rank
-   **Potentials:** 16 × current rank (magical characters only)
-   **Feats:** 40 XP each

### Character Tiers

| Tier | XP Range | Sessions (24/session) | D&D Equivalent |
|------|----------|----------------------|----------------|
| 1 | 0–120 | ~5 | Levels 1–2 |
| 2 | 120–360 | ~10 | Levels 3–5 |
| 3 | 360–600 | ~10 | Levels 6–8 |
| 4 | 600–840 | ~10 | Levels 9–11 |
| 5 | 840–1080 | ~10 | Levels 12–14 |
| 6 | 1080–1320 | ~10 | Levels 15–17 |
| 7 | 1320–1560 | ~10 | Levels 18–19 |
| 8 | 1560+ | ~10+ | Level 20 |


##### Progression Rate: At 24 XP per session:
-   Tier 1→2: ~5 sessions
-   Tier 2→3: ~10 sessions
-   Tier 3→4: ~10 sessions
-   Tier 4→5: ~10 sessions
-   Tier 5→6: ~10 sessions
-   Tier 6→7: ~10 sessions
-   Tier 7→8: ~10 sessions

##### Notes on Feat Limits:
-   The 2 starting feats are FREE and do NOT count against tier limits
-   Tier limits apply only to feats purchased with XP
-   This allows characters to grow from 4 feats (Tier 1) to 18 feats (Tier 8)
-   Characters can still mix and match feat types freely (martial + magical, etc.)

## The Dying Mechanic

### Reaching 0 HP
-   Any attack that reduces you to 0 HP or below stops at 0 HP (excess damage ignored)
-   Immediately gain Dying, Unconscious, Blinded, and Prone conditions

### Stabilization Attempts
On your turn while Dying:

#### At 0 HP: Make Fortitude save (Constitution + Current Luck)
-   1+ successes: Stabilize at 0 HP (Dying ends, remain Unconscious, Blinded and Prone)
-   0 successes: Drop to -1 HP

### Death Threshold
If negative HP equals your Constitution score, you die
-   **Example:** Constitution 4 character dies at -4 HP

#### Ally Assistance
An ally can use an [Interact] action to stabilize you with a Medicine
check:
-   2 successes: You stabilize at 0 HP
-   1 success: You gain -1 to both dice on your next stabilization save

Magical healing immediately restores you to consciousness and removes
Dying, Unconscious, and Blinded conditions.

### Recovering from Stabilization
Once stabilized, you remain Unconscious, Blinded and Prone.
At the end of your next turn, make a Will save (Wisdom + Luck):
-   1+ successes: Regain consciousness with 1 HP. Remove Unconscious and Blinded conditions. Receive Grievously Wounded condition
-   0 successes: Remain Unconscious, Blinded and Prone. Repeat save each turn
