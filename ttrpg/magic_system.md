### Magic Effect Types & Terminology

#### Damage Effects (Destructive Magic)
Weaves that deal direct harm through elemental or negative energy.  Uses Fire, Air, Water, Earth, or Negative as primary energy. These weaves deal direct harm through elemental or negative energy and are referred to as damage weaves. Key characteristic: targets take HP damage.

**Common Examples:** Fireball, lightning bolt, Hailstorm, acid blast, necrotic blast

#### mind-affecting effects (Mind-Affecting Magic)
Any weave that alters a creature's mental state, emotions, or thoughts without direct mind control. Typically uses Negative energy (for fear, sleep, mental assault) or Positive energy (for courage, inspiration, euphoria). Creatures immune to psychic effects or described as "mindless" are immune to mind-affecting effects.

**Includes:** Charm, fear, sleep, emotion manipulation, mental influence
**Does NOT include:** Direct mind control (compulsion), illusory effects, or physical transformations
**Common Examples:** Beguiling Weave, Sleep, Terror Weave, heroism

**Immunity Note:** When a creature is listed as "immune to mind-affecting effects" or "immune to mind-affecting effects (charm, fear, sleep)," they cannot be affected by any weaves that rely on mental/emotional manipulation. Constructs, undead, and mindless creatures typically have this immunity.

#### illusory effects (False Perception)
Weaves that create false sensory information or conceal the truth. Primarily uses Space energy to manipulate perception and create false images or sounds. May also use Air energy for auditory illusory effects or Negative energy for shadow-based illusory effects.

**Key Characteristic:** Creates false perceptions, doesn't change reality
**Seeing Through illusory effects:** Creatures with truesight, blindsight, or tremorsense may see through illusory effects automatically. Physical interaction typically reveals an illusory effect as false (you can pass your hand through it, it has no substance, etc.).

**Common Examples:** Phantom Image, invisibility, False Visage, Complex Illusion

#### Protective Effects (Warding Magic)
Weaves that create barriers, wards, or defensive magic. Primarily uses Space energy to create force barriers or Reactive Ward effects. These are referred to as protective weaves or wards.

**Common Examples:** Reactive Ward, Force Armor, protection from energy, CounterWeave, Unweave

#### Transformation Effects (Physical Alteration)
Weaves that physically change or enhance creatures or objects. Uses elemental energies (Earth, Fire, Water, Air) to reshape matter, or Positive/Negative to enhance/wither living tissue.

**Common Examples:** Beastial Transformation, Size Shift, stone shape, enhance ability

#### Summoning & Teleportation Effects (Spatial Manipulation)
Weaves that move creatures/objects through space or bring things from other places. Uses Space energy as primary, often with Time energy for duration of summons.

**Common Examples:** Teleport, Spatial Step, summon creature, create food and water

#### Information & Prophecy Effects (Temporal/Spatial Perception)
Weaves that gather information, predict the future, or perceive distant locations. Uses Space energy (scrying, detection) or Time energy (foresight, prophecy).

**Common Examples:** Sense Magic, scrying, foresight, identify, Object Seeking

### The Eight Magical Energies
1.  Earth - Stone, metal, earth magic
2.  Air - Wind, lightning, sound
3.  Fire - Flame, heat, light
4.  Water - Ice, liquid, steam
5.  Positive - Healing, growth, life
6.  Negative - Decay, necrotic, shadow, death
7.  Time - Haste, slow, temporal manipulation
8.  Space - Teleportation, portals, distance, barriers


### Pneuma and Necromancy

**Pneuma** is the soul-essence that connects all living beings to the planes. Every creature's pneuma acts as a conduit through which magical energies flow. When a mage weaves fire or a cleric channels healing, they are directing elemental and conceptual energies *through* their pneuma—but they are not manipulating the pneuma itself.

**The Eight Energies:**
- **Elemental:** Earth, Air, Fire, Water (Physical forces)
- **Vital:** Positive (life, growth, healing) and Negative (entropy, decay, harm)
- **Conceptual:** Space (distance, barriers, perception) and Time (duration, speed, causality)

All eight energies flow *through* pneuma as a conduit, but standard weaving does not manipulate souls directly.

#### Necromancy: The Forbidden Art

Necromancy is not simply "death magic" or harmful spells. Necromancy is the direct manipulation, binding, trapping, or consumption of pneuma (souls) themselves. This forbidden knowledge:

- **Was mastered by the First Men** through their study of pneuma and its connection to the outer realms
- **Has been lost to time** and is unknown to current inhabitants of Athelu
- **Tarnishes the caster's pneuma**, attracting malevolent daemons and corrupting the soul
- **Requires GM permission** and significant story justification to learn
- **Cannot be taken at character creation** it must be discovered through gameplay

#### The [Necromantic] Keyword

Weaves marked with the **[Necromantic]** keyword are forbidden and represent lost First Men knowledge. These weaves don't merely channel Negative energy for harm—they bind, trap, reshape, or consume souls:

**Examples of Necromantic Weaves:**
- **Bind the Fallen** - Binding soul fragments or echoes to corpses
- **Soul Cage** - Trapping a departing soul in a vessel
- **Magic Jar** - Displacing souls between bodies
- **Speak with Dead** - Forcing communion with departed souls
- **Create Undead** - Binding stronger soul remnants to corpses
- **Finger of Death** - Killing and instantly raising as undead (soul binding)

**Non-Necromantic Uses of Negative Energy:**

The following are *not* necromantic, as they channel entropy and harm without manipulating souls:
- **Inflict Wounds** - Channeling decay and necrotic energy
- **Harm** - Draining life force
- **Withering Touch** - Withering and entropy
- **Curse Weaving** - Imposing misfortune
- **Shadow-based effects** - Manipulating darkness and shadow
- **Ray of Enfeeblement** - Weakening through entropy

#### Identifying Necromantic Intent

**Ask these questions:**
1. Does the weave bind, trap, or manipulate a soul?
2. Does it create undead (which requires binding soul energy to corpses)?
3. Does it force interaction with departed souls against their will?
4. Does it consume or damage pneuma directly?

If yes to any of these, the weave is necromantic and requires the **[Necromantic]** keyword.

**Using Negative Energy ≠ Necromancy**

A cleric channeling Negative energy to harm living creatures, or a wizard casting Blight to wither plants, is using entropy and decay—not manipulating souls. These are standard (if dark) magical practices and do not carry the corruption and forbidden nature of true necromancy.

#### GM Guidelines for Necromancy

If players discover lost First Men texts or forbidden knowledge:

1. **Require significant in-game discovery** - This cannot simply be learned through normal advancement
2. **Warn of consequences** - Necromancy attracts daemons and corrupts the caster's pneuma
3. **Consider alignment and story** - This is dark magic with serious narrative weight
4. **Use sparingly** - Necromancy should remain rare and dangerous, not a common tool
5. **Apply penalties** - Regular use might impose Misfortune on certain rolls, attract unwanted attention, or cause other story consequences

The forbidden nature of necromancy is a feature, not a bug—it should feel dangerous and consequential when encountered.

#### Magical Potentials & Mastery

##### Potentials (1-8, like attributes)
- Raw magical affinity for each energy
- Rolled at character creation (8d8, assign results)
- Can be raised with XP (costs same as attributes: 16 × current rank)
- Determines maximum Energy you can spend in that type

##### Mastery (1-8, like skills)
- Trained control of each energy
- All start at rank 0 (untrained)
- Can be raised with XP (costs same as skills)
- Cannot exceed corresponding Potential
- Determines reliability when weaving

#### Energy Pool Formula
Energy Pool = (Sum of 8 Potentials) + (Casting Stat × 2) + Constitution + (Total Mastery Ranks ÷ 2, rounded down)
Energy regenerates fully after long rest.

#### Determining Magical Potentials

How you determine your Magical Potentials depends on which magical trait you selected during character creation. See **Part 4: Traits** for complete details on:

- **Mageborn** (Arcane Weaving)
- **Divine Gift** (Divine Weaving)
- **Invoker Magic** (Invoker Weaving)
- **Sorcerous Origin** (Innate Weaving)
- **Eldritch Pact** (Pact Weaving)

Each trait specifies how many dice to roll, which energies you have access to, and which energies receive bonuses based on your chosen specialization (Elemental Affinity, Divine Path, Force of Will Manifestation, Pact Type, or Oath).


### Weaving (Casting) Mechanics

#### Step 1: Declare Intent
- What effect do you want?
- Which energies will you use?

#### Step 2: Allocate Energy Points
- Choose Primary Energy (determines effect type)
- Optional: Supporting Energy (modifies range/area/duration)
- Spend points from your Energy Pool

#### Step 3: Make Weaving Roll
- Roll Primary Potential + Primary Mastery (2d8)
- If using supporting energy: Also roll Secondary Potential + Secondary Mastery (2d8)
- Total possible: Up to 4 successes (5 with a critical roll)

#### Step 4: Apply Overspending Penalties
- If Energy Points spent exceed your Mastery in that energy:
  - Penalty = Add 1 to both die results per point over Mastery
  - Applies to BOTH Potential and Mastery dice for that energy
- Cannot spend more than your Potential (absolute ceiling)

#### Weaving Success Results
##### 0 successes:
- Weave fails
- Lose half Energy Points spent (rounded up)

##### 1 success:
- Weave works at reduced effectiveness
- Damage weaves: Reduce by 1 die or half damage
- Utility weaves: Reduced duration/range

##### 2 successes:
- Weave works as designed at full power

##### 3 successes:
- Enhanced effect
- Damage: +1d8 bonus damage
- Utility: Extended duration or bonus effect

##### 4 successes:
- Maximum power/critical success
- Damage: Maximum on one die or spectacular effect
- Utility: Double duration or overwhelming power

**Notes:** Duration from Supporting Energy (Time) for ongoing effects.

#### SUPPORTING ENERGY TABLES

Supporting Energy modifies the delivery and scope of your Primary effect.

**Range Energy:** Space.
**Area Energy:** Space
**Duration Energy:** Time.
**Range/Area and Duration:** Supporting Space energy covers the cost of both (add costs together).
***Exception***
   When your Primary Energy IS Space, add the area/range and Duration cost to the primary energy cost.

##### Supporting Energy: Range (typically Air or Space)
- 0 points: Touch
- 1 point: Close (30 feet)
- 2 points: Medium (60 feet)
- 3+ points: Long (120 feet)

##### Supporting Energy: Area Effect (typically Air or Space)
- 0 points: Single target
- 1 point: 2 targets or 10ft radius
- 2 points: 4 targets or 20ft radius
- 3+ points: 6 targets or 30ft radius

**AOE Damage Application:**
When a damage weave affects multiple targets through area effect:
- **Each target in the area takes the full listed damage**
- Damage is NOT divided among targets
- Each target makes their own saving throw (if applicable)

**Example:** Flame Burst (Fire 3 = 16 damage base, Space 1 = 2 targets)
- First target: 16 fire damage (makes own save)
- Second target: 16 fire damage (makes own save)

##### Supporting Energy: Duration (typically Time or element)
- 0 points: Instantaneous
- 1 point: 1 round (8 seconds)
- 2 points: 1 minute
- 3 points: 10 minutes
- 4 points: 1 hour
- 5 points: 4 hours
- 6 points: 12 hours
- 7 points: 1 day
- 8 points: 1 week

##### Supporting Energy: Simple Weaves
Simple Weaves use only a single energy type (no supporting energy) and are limited in scope:

**Range Limitations:**
- **No Air or Space for range** = Touch to 5-10 feet maximum
- Simple damage weaves are energy emanations from the caster's body, not shaped projectiles
- Think "channeling fire through your palm" vs "shaping and hurling a fire bolt"

**Other Limitations:**
- **No area effects** (single target only)
- **No duration** (instantaneous effects only)
- **No complex transformations** (supporting energy needed for range/area/duration)

**Simple Weave Benefits:**
- Cost only 1 [Combat] action (vs 2 for Complex Weaves)
- Do NOT provoke opportunity attacks (quick, instinctive magic)
- Lower energy cost (typically 2-3 Energy vs 3-4+ for Complex)
- Can be cast multiple times per round

**Tactical Use:**
- When caught in melee: Use Simple Weaves to avoid opportunity attacks
- When at range: Use Complex Weaves for better damage and range
- Risk/Reward: Simple Weaves require close proximity but don't provoke

### Extended Casting Time

When casting a weave with duration (using Time or Space for duration component), you can extend the casting time to reduce the duration energy cost:

**Duration Energy Reduction:**
- **1 minute casting time:** -2 to duration energy cost
- **10 minutes casting time:** -4 to duration energy cost  
- **1 hour casting time:** -6 to duration energy cost

**Rules:**
- Only reduces the energy spent on duration (Time cost, or the duration portion of Space cost)
- Cannot reduce duration cost below 0
- Cannot be used in combat or while threatened
- Interruption causes failure and wastes half the total Energy (rounded up)

**Interaction with Ritual Casting (Mageborn):**
The Mageborn Ritual Casting trait (half total Energy for 10-minute ritual) is separate and more powerful. If both could apply, use whichever is better.

**Example: Barkward for All-Day Protection**
- Standard: Earth 4 + Space 2 (touch + 1 minute) = 6 Energy, 2 actions
- All-day prep: Earth 4 + Space 7 (touch + 1 day) = 11 Energy base
  - With 1 hour casting: Space 7 - 6 = Space 1 for duration portion
  - Final: Earth 4 + Space 1 = 5 Energy, requires 1 hour

**Design Philosophy:**
Simple Weaves represent raw magical energy channeled directly through the caster's body without the time, concentration, and shaping required for Complex Weaves. They are instinctive bursts of power rather than carefully crafted effects.

### Building Spells with the Tables

#### Choosing Simple vs Complex Weaves:

**Simple Weave (1 action):**
- Uses only Primary Energy (no supporting energy)
- Limited to touch or 5-10ft range
- Single target, instantaneous effect
- Does NOT provoke opportunity attacks
- Examples: Fire Burst, Lightning Touch, Frost Touch

**Complex Weave (2 actions):**
- Uses Primary + Supporting Energy (or multiple energies)
- Can achieve range, area effects, or duration
- DOES provoke opportunity attacks when cast while threatened
- Examples: Fire Bolt, Fireball, Flame Burst

#### Step-by-Step Process:
1.  Choose your Primary effect type (damage, healing, buff, control, etc.)
2.  Decide if you need range/area/duration (if yes → Complex Weave)
3.  Find the appropriate Primary Energy cost from the table
4.  If Complex: Add Supporting Energy for:
    - Range (if not touch): Air/Space 1-3
    - Area (if multiple targets): Space 1-3+
    - Duration (if not instant): Time 1-8
5.  Calculate total Energy cost
6.  Determine action cost: Simple (1 action) or Complex (2 actions)

##### Example - Fireball:
- Primary: Fire 5 (24 damage, 3rd level power)
- Supporting: Space 3 (medium range + 20ft radius)
- Total: 8 Energy

##### Example - Mend Flesh:
- Primary: Positive 3 (8 HP healing, 1st level power)
- Supporting: Touch (0) or +1 for Close range
- Total: 3 Energy at touch, 4 at range

### Magic in Combat

#### Attack Weaves (like Fire Bolt, Lightning)
- Weaving successes determine hit quality automatically
- No separate attack roll needed
- Apply damage based on successes

#### Save Weaves (like Fireball, Charm)
- Weaver generates X successes from weaving roll
- Target makes appropriate save (Fortitude/Reflex/Will)
- Net Successes = Weaver Successes - Target Successes
- Apply effect based on net successes:
  - 0 or less: Target resists completely
  - 1: Reduced effect (half damage, weakened)
  - 2: Full effect
  - 3: Enhanced effect
  - 4: Overwhelming/maximum effect

##### Saving Throws
- Fortitude : Resists fire, cold, poison, physical effects
- Reflex : Resists area effects, explosions
- Will : Resists mind control, fear, charm, illusory effects

#### Attack Weaves vs Save Weaves

Weaves fall into two categories based on how they interact with targets:

##### Attack Weaves (No Saving Throw)
**Characteristics:**
- Single-target direct effects
- Touch-range direct damage
- Weaving successes alone determine effectiveness
- No opposed roll by target

**Weave Types:**
- Single-target ranged damage (Fire Bolt, Frost Ray, Lightning Touch)
- Touch-range damage spells
- Single-target healing (Mend Flesh, Healing Burst)
- Single-target buffs that benefit the target

**Success Determination:**
- 0 successes: Miss/fail
- 1 success: Reduced effect (typically half damage or half duration)
- 2 successes: Full effect as listed
- 3 successes: Enhanced effect (+8 damage or extended duration)
- 4 successes: Maximum effect (+16 damage or double duration)

**Example - Fire Bolt:**
Caster rolls Fire Potential + Fire Mastery + Air Potential + Air Mastery (4d8)
- 0 successes: Miss, no damage
- 1 success: 4 damage (half of 8)
- 2 successes: 8 damage (full)
- 3 successes: 16 damage (8 + 8 bonus)
- 4 successes: 24 damage (8 + 16 bonus)

##### Save Weaves (Saving Throw Allowed)
**Characteristics:**
- Area effect damage
- Control/debuff effects
- Transformation effects
- Ongoing effects

**Weave Types:**
- Area damage (Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Flame Burst, Freezing Blast)
- Line effects (Lightning Bolt, Wall of Fire)
- Control spells (Binding Paralysis, Sleep, Slow, Fear)
- Debuffs (Blindness, Curse, Poison)
- Transformation (Beastial Transformation, Petrification)

**Success Determination - Opposed Roll:**
1. **Caster rolls weaving:** Count successes normally from weaving roll
2. **Each target rolls save:** Count successes from appropriate save (Reflex/Fortitude/Will)
3. **Calculate Net Successes:** Net = Caster Successes - Target Successes
4. **Apply effect based on net successes:**
   - Net 0 or less: Target resists/reduces effect significantly
   - Net 1: Reduced effect (typically half damage)
   - Net 2: Full effect as listed
   - Net 3: Enhanced effect
   - Net 4: Maximum effect

**Important:** Even when net successes are 0 or negative, some spells still deal partial damage. Check individual spell descriptions for "minimum effect" rules.

**Example - Fireball:**
Caster rolls 3 successes on weaving (Fire + Space)
- Target A rolls 1 success on Reflex save: Net 2, takes full 28 damage
- Target B rolls 2 successes on Reflex save: Net 1, takes half (14 damage)
- Target C rolls 3 successes on Reflex save: Net 0, takes no damage
- Target D rolls 4 successes on Reflex save: Net -1, takes no damage

#### Which Save Type Applies?

The save type is determined by the effect being resisted:

**Reflex (Agility + Luck) - Dodging/Avoiding:**
- Area damage effects (explosions, fire, lightning, acid)
- Physical hazards (falling objects, crushing walls)
- Sudden environmental changes
- Effects you can physically dodge

**Fortitude (Constitution + Luck) - Enduring/Resisting:**
- Poison and disease
- Physical transformation (petrification, Beastial Transformation)
- Death effects
- Constitution-draining effects
- Cold/heat endurance

**Will (Wisdom + Luck) - Mental Resistance:**
- Mind control and domination
- Fear and morale effects
- Charm and compulsion
- illusory effects (to disbelieve)
- Sleep and unconsciousness effects
- **Note:** Creatures described as "mindless" or "immune tomind-affecting effects" automatically succeed on Will saves against mind-affecting effectss (charm, fear, sleep, emotion manipulation). See **Magic Effect Types & Terminology** section for details.

**When in Doubt:**
- If it's an explosion or area damage → Reflex
- If it changes your body or kills you → Fortitude
- If it affects your mind or emotions → Will

**Effect Type Guidelines:**
- **Damage weaves** (destruction magic): Reflex for area effects, no save for single-target attack weaves
- **mind-affecting effects** (mind-affecting): Always Will save. Mindless creatures immune.
- **illusory effects** (false perception): Will save to disbelieve if suspicious. Some creatures see through automatically.
- **Transformation effects** (physical alteration): Fortitude save for unwilling targets
- **Teleportation/forced movement**: Reflex save for unwilling targets
- **Protective effects** (buffs, wards): Usually no save (benefits target)

For complete effect type definitions, see the **Magic Effect Types & Terminology** section for more information.

### Damage Resistance (DR) and Magical Damage

Physical armor and natural defenses interact differently with magical damage based on the energy type.

#### Energy Damage - Half DR (Rounded Down)

**Energy-based magical damage types apply half DR:**
- **Fire** (flames, heat, burning)
- **Cold** (frost, ice energy, freezing)
- **Lightning** (electricity, shock)
- **Acid** (corrosive energy)
- **Thunder** (sonic energy, sound waves)
- **Negative** (life-draining, necrotic energy)
- **Positive** (radiant, divine energy)
- **Force** (pure magical energy)
- **Psychic** (mental damage)

**Formula:** Damage - (DR ÷ 2, rounded down)

**Examples:**
- 16 fire damage vs DR 4 → 16 - 2 = **14 damage**
- 8 lightning damage vs DR 3 → 8 - 1 = **7 damage**
- 28 cold damage vs DR 6 → 28 - 3 = **25 damage**
- 8 acid damage vs DR 1 → 8 - 0 = **8 damage** (DR 1 provides no protection)

**Rationale:** Pure energy can partially bypass physical armor but heavy armor still provides some protection through insulation, dispersion, and reduced exposed area.

#### Physical Magic Damage - Full DR

**Physical-based magical effects respect full DR:**
- **HailStorm** (physical ice chunks and hail)
- **Meteor Swarm** (physical meteors with impact)
- **Conjured Weapons** (summoned blades, magical projectiles)
- **Stone Shape** (crushing stone)
- **Earthquake** (falling debris, collapsing structures)
- **Wall of Stone/Ice** (physical crushing)
- **Thorn Whip** (physical thorns)
- **Any spell creating physical objects that strike/crush**

**Formula:** Damage - DR (normal physical damage reduction)

**Examples:**
- HailStorm 28 damage vs DR 4 → 28 - 4 = **24 damage**
- Meteor 40 damage vs DR 6 → 40 - 6 = **34 damage**
- Conjured Blade 10 damage vs DR 3 → 10 - 3 = **7 damage**

**Rationale:** These spells create actual physical matter or force that impacts like mundane weapons. Armor protects normally.

#### Quick Reference Table

| Damage Type | DR Application | Example Spell |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Fire | Half DR | Fire Bolt, Fireball, Flame Burst |
| Cold | Half DR | Frost Ray, Freezing Blast |
| Lightning | Half DR | Lightning Bolt, Lightning Touch |
| Acid | Half DR | Acid Blast, Acid Arrow |
| Thunder | Half DR | Thunder Burst, Shatter |
| Negative | Half DR | Chill Touch, Blight, Vampiric Touch |
| Positive | Half DR | Holy Fire, Radiant Bolt |
| Force | Half DR | Unerring Bolt  |
| Psychic | Half DR | Mind Blast, Psychic Scream |
| Physical Ice | Full DR | HailStorm (ice chunks) |
| Physical Stone | Full DR | Meteor Swarm, Conjured weapons |
| Physical Debris | Full DR | Earthquake, Avalanche |

#### Elemental Resistance (Separate from DR)

Some creatures have specific elemental resistances or immunities listed in their stat blocks. These are separate from DR and stack with DR reduction.

**Application Order:**
1. Apply DR reduction (half or full depending on damage type)
2. Apply elemental resistance (subtract listed amount)
3. Apply vulnerability (add listed amount)

**Example:** Red Dragon with DR 5 and Fire Immunity
- Fireball 28 fire damage → Immune, takes 0 damage
- HailStorm 28 cold damage → 28 - 5 (full DR for physical ice) = 23 damage

**Example:** Frost Giant with DR 4 and Cold Resistance 8
- Freezing Blast d 28 damage → 28 - 2 (half DR) - 8 (resistance) = **18 damage**
- Fireball 28 damage → 28 - 2 (half DR) = **26 damage**

#### Special Cases

**Force Damage (Unerring Bolt, etc.):**
- Applies half DR
- Almost never resisted (very rare to have Force Resistance)
- Considered pure magical energy

**Healing (Positive Energy):**
- DR does not reduce healing
- Negative Energy Resistance does not reduce healing

**Spell Damage Types in Descriptions:**
Each spell description now includes:
- **Damage Type:** [Energy type or Physical]
- **DR Interaction:** [Half DR / Full DR / Ignores DR]

### Condition Application in Weaves

Many weaves can inflict conditions on targets when achieving high success thresholds. The conditions applied depend on the primary energy type used in the weave and the power level of the spell.

#### Success Threshold Framework

**Attack Weaves (No Saving Throw):**
- 0 successes: Miss
- 1 success: Partial effect (typically half damage)
- 2 successes: Full effect
- 3 successes: Enhanced effect + minor condition
- 4 successes: Maximum effect + major condition
- 5+ successes: Overwhelming effect + severe or multiple conditions

**Save Weaves (With Saving Throw):**
- Net 0 or less: Resisted/minimal effect
- Net 1: Reduced effect (typically half damage)
- Net 2: Full effect
- Net 3: Enhanced effect + minor condition
- Net 4: Maximum effect + major condition
- Net 5+: Overwhelming effect + severe or multiple conditions

**Note:** Net successes = Caster's total successes - Target's save successes

#### Condition Selection by Energy Type

Conditions should thematically match the primary energy used in the weave. Reference the conditions document for full condition rules.

##### Fire Energy Conditions
**Minor (3 successes / Net 3):**
- Singed
- Smoldering

- Banished (sent to another plane)
- Stunned (reality distortion)
- Grappled + Teleported

##### Time Energy Conditions
**Minor (3 successes / Net 3):**
- Slowed (minor - speed/initiative penalty)
- Disoriented (lost sense of timing)

**Major (4 successes / Net 4):**
- Slowed (major - 2 actions only)
- Stunned (frozen in time)
- Aged (Exhaustion gained)

**Severe (5+ successes / Net 5+):**
- Paralyzed (time frozen)
- Slowed (1 action only)
- Temporal displacement

#### Power Level Restrictions

The severity of conditions that can be applied depends on the weave's Energy cost:

**Simple Weave Level (1-2 Energy):**
- Maximum at 3 successes: Minor condition only
- Maximum at 4 successes: Major condition (single effect, not most severe)
- No severe conditions available

**Low Level (3-4 Energy):**
- 3 successes: Minor or moderate condition
- 4 successes: Major condition
- 5+ successes: Major + minor, or severe for 1 round only

**Medium Level (5-6 Energy):**
- 3 successes: Major condition
- 4 successes: Severe condition or major + minor
- 5+ successes: Severe + additional effects

**High Level (7-8 Energy):**
- 3 successes: Severe condition possible
- 4 successes: Severe condition + significant effect
- 5+ successes: Multiple conditions or long-duration severe effects

#### Condition Duration Guidelines

Unless specified in the spell description:
- **Minor conditions:** Typically 1 action to 1 round
- **Major conditions:** Typically 1 round to 1 minute, with saves to end
- **Severe conditions:** Typically 1 minute to 10 minutes, with saves to end

**Recovery Saves:**
Most magical conditions allow the target to attempt a save at the end of each of their turns to end the effect. The save type is typically the same as the initial save (Reflex/Fortitude/Will).

#### Examples in Practice

**Fire Bolt (Fire 2, Simple Weave):**
- 3 successes: 16 damage + Singed (minor - subtract 1 from next die)
- 4 successes: 24 damage + Ignited (major - 1d8 per turn, action to extinguish)
- 5+ successes: 32 damage + Ignited + Dazzled (multiple conditions)

**Fireball (Fire 5, Medium Level AOE):**
- Net 3: 36 damage + Frightened (major - add 1 to dice while visible)
- Net 4: 44 damage + Ignited (major ongoing damage)
- Net 5+: 52 damage + Burning (severe - 2d8 per turn, hard to extinguish)

**Binding Paralysis (Space 4, Low Level Control):**
- Net 2: Paralyzed for 1 minute (save each turn)
- Net 3: Paralyzed + Misfortune on saves (harder to break)
- Net 4: Paralyzed + affects 2 targets
- Net 5+: Paralyzed for 1 hour + affects 2 targets

**Lightning Bolt (Air 5, Medium Level AOE):**
- Net 3: 36 damage + Dazed (minor - penalties next action)
- Net 4: 44 damage + Stunned (major - no actions for 1 round)
- Net 5+: 52 damage + Stunned + Prone (multiple conditions)

#### GM Guidelines for Condition Application

1. **Check Energy Type:** Conditions must thematically match the primary energy
2. **Check Power Level:** Don't exceed the condition caps for that power level
3. **Check Success Threshold:** Minor at 3, major at 4, severe at 5+
4. **Check Spell Description:** Individual spells may specify different conditions
5. **Be Consistent:** Similar spells should apply similar conditions

When creating custom weaves or adjudicating edge cases, prioritize thematic appropriateness over mechanical optimization. A fire spell should never freeze someone, and a cold spell should never ignite them.

For complete condition descriptions, mechanics, and recovery rules, see the **Conditions** document.

### Channel Divinity (Divine Gift Only)

#### Core Ability
Automatic for all Divine Gift characters.
- Action: Channel Divinity [Combat] (2 actions)
- Uses: Once per short rest, or spend 1 Luck point for additional use
- Cost: Minimum 4 Energy Points, can spend more (up to Positive or Negative Potential)
- Range: 30-foot radius centered on you
- No Roll Required: Channeling automatically succeeds for Heal/Harm intents

#### Available Channel Options by Divine Path

**Good Paths (Divine Gift - Good/Neutral deities):**
- Channel Positive - HEAL Intent
- Channel Positive - HARM Intent (undead only)
- Channel Positive - TURN Intent (undead only)

**Evil Paths (Divine Gift - Evil deities):**
- Channel Negative - HEAL Intent (undead only)
- Channel Negative - HARM Intent (living creatures)
- Channel Negative - COMMAND Intent (undead only)

#### The Six Channel Types

##### 1. Channel Positive - HEAL Intent (Good Paths Only)
- ALL living creatures within range heal 1d8 HP per 4 Energy spent
- Affects: Living creatures (anything that can be healed)
- Does NOT affect: Undead
- Indiscriminate: Heals friends AND enemies

##### 2. Channel Positive - HARM Intent (Good Paths Only)
- ALL undead within range take 1d8 positive damage per 4 Energy spent
- Affects: Undead only
- Does NOT affect: Living creatures
- No save (raw divine power)
- Indiscriminate: Damages ALL undead

##### 3. Channel Positive - TURN Intent (Good Paths Only)
- All undead within range must resist
- Channeler rolls: Wisdom + Positive Mastery (2d8, count successes)
- Each undead rolls: Will save (Wisdom + Luck, count successes)
- Compare successes:
  - Undead gets fewer: Flees for 1 minute, cannot approach within 30 feet
  - Undead equals or exceeds: Resists, no effect
- Indiscriminate: Turns ALL undead

##### 4. Channel Negative - HEAL Intent (Evil Paths Only)
- ALL undead within range heal 1d8 HP per 4 Energy spent
- Affects: Undead only
- Does NOT affect: Living creatures
- Indiscriminate: Heals ALL undead

##### 5. Channel Negative - HARM Intent (Evil Paths Only)
- ALL living creatures within range take 1d8 negative damage per 4 Energy spent
- Affects: Living creatures only (including the channeler!)
- Does NOT affect: Undead
- Reflex save (Agility + Luck): Count successes, reduce damage by 1d8 per success (minimum 0)
- Indiscriminate: Damages caster, allies, AND enemies

##### 6. Channel Negative - COMMAND Intent (Evil Paths Only)
- Target one undead within range (not area effect)
- Channeler rolls: Wisdom + Negative Mastery (2d8, count successes)
- Target rolls: Will save (Wisdom + Luck, count successes)
- Compare successes:
  - You get more: Undead obeys commands for 1 minute
  - Tie or target wins: Resists, no effect

#### Key Principle
##### Intent Overrides Energy Type:
- Heal intent: Only heals (never harms)
- Harm intent: Only harms (never heals)
- Special intents: Turn/Command require opposed rolls

**Alignment Restriction:** Your Divine Path determines which channel options are available. Good paths (Cleric, Druid) use Positive energy to heal allies and destroy undead. Evil paths (Death Cleric, Blight Druid) use Negative energy to heal undead, harm living creatures, and command the dead.
