# D8 TTRPG System - Core Rules v2.1

## Core Concept

A classless tabletop roleplaying game built entirely around the number
eight, using d8 dice and a roll equal-to-or-under system with success
counting.

## Design Notes

### Core Design Principles

-   Everything based on the number 8
-   Roll Equal-to-or-under system rewards investment
-   Success counting creates gradients
-   Resource management (Luck, Energy) creates tactical decisions
-   Classless system allows flexible character concepts

### Key Features

-   Luck depletion: Rising tension throughout sessions
-   Overspending penalties: Heroic risk-taking with consequences
-   4-success weaving: Combining energies increases power ceiling
-   Opposed combat: Every fight tactical
-   Critical restoration: Double 1s create legendary moments
-   Channel Divinity: Reliable but indiscriminate area effects
-   Static HP: Combat remains dangerous at all Tiers (levels)
-   Armor matters: DR system makes protection crucial

### Flaws and Traits
-   Access to some powerful abilities and character options (traits) require taking flaws
-   Flaws and traits may only be taken during character creation
-   Taking a flaw provides points to purchase traits
-   You cannot spend more points on traits than you have gained from flaws

#### Flaws
-   Flaws represent Physical and Societal penalties the character has/must endure.
-   Flaws range in value from 1 - 10.
-   Some Flaws require DM Approval

#### Traits
-   Traits represent heightened abilities as well as access to the magic system
-   Traits range in value from 1 - 10
-   Some Traits require DM Approval

### Feats
-   Feats provide access to abilities that would normally be given via a class

-   The rules are broken down into different sections for easier management
