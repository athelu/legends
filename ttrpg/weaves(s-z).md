### Wall of Stone
-   **Primary Energy:** Earth 6 (solid stone barrier)
-   **Supporting Energy:** Space 2 (wall shape)
-   **Total Cost:** 8 Energy
-   **Action:** Complex weave (2 actions)
-   **Weaving Roll:** Earth Potential + Earth Mastery + Space Potential + Space Mastery (4d8)
-   **Effect:** Create permanent wall of stone at medium range (60ft) up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, 6 inches thick (or 30 feet long and 1 foot thick). Each 10ft section has HP = 16 + Earth Potential, DR 4. Can shape into crenellations, bridges, etc.
-   **Saving Throw:** None (creates barrier)
-   **Success Scaling:** 1 = 1 minute duration only, 2 = permanent, 3 = double HP, 4 = triple HP and can create complex shapes

### Web
-   **Primary Energy:** Earth 4 (sticky webbing control effect)
-   **Supporting Energy:** Space 4 (medium range 60ft + area 20ft radius + duration 1 minute)
-   **Total Cost:** 8 Energy
-   **Action:** Complex weave (2 actions)
-   **Weaving Roll:** Earth Potential + Earth Mastery + Space Potential + Space Mastery (4d8)
-   **Effect:** Fill area with sticky webs anchored to surfaces. Creatures in area when created or entering area make Reflex save. Compare their successes to your weaving successes. If you have more, target becomes Restrained. Restrained creatures can use action + Athletics or Acrobatics check (2 successes needed) to escape. Webs are flammable; fire damage to 5ft area destroys webs in that section.
-   **Saving Throw:** Reflex (to avoid being Restrained)
-   **Success Scaling (Net successes = Your successes - Their successes):** 1 = Partial web (10ft radius, 1 round), 2 = Full effect (20ft radius, 1 minute), 3 = Enhanced (30ft radius, 10 minutes), 4 = Maximum (40ft radius, 1 hour)
-   **Restrained Condition:** See conditions document. Target cannot move, has Misfortune on attacks, attackers have Fortune against them, Misfortune on Reflex saves.

-   **Total Cost:** 6 Energy
-   **Action:** Complex weave (2 actions)
-   **Weaving Roll:** Positive Potential + Positive Mastery + Time Potential + Time Mastery (4d8)
-   **Effect:** Create 15-foot radius sphere at close range (30ft). All creatures in area make Will saves. Compare your weaving successes to each target's save successes.

Creatures immune to charm are immune.
-   **Saving Throw:** Will (to resist compulsion to speak truth)
-   **Success Scaling (Net successes = Your successes - Their successes):** 1 = 1 minute, 2 = full effect, 3 = 1 hour, 4 = 20-foot radius
-   **Note:** Invokers create a space where true names resonate, making falsehoods impossible to speak
