# D8 TTRPG - Part 8: Equipment
## Currency

It is necessary to establish some type of currency for the game system to allow for the purchasing of equipment during the character creation process at least. We will leverages the standard coin types:
- Copper Piece (cp)
- Silver Piece (sp)
- Gold Piece (gp)

**Exchange Rates:**
- 10 cp = 1 sp
- 10 sp = 1 gp

For a value proposition, lets assume $1 = 5 cp.
