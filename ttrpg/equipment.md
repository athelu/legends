**Two-Handed:** Requires both hands to wield. Cannot be used with shields or in Two-Weapon Fighting.

**Finesse:** Can use either Strength or Agility for damage calculations (player's choice). Attack rolls always use Agility + Melee Combat (as standard for all melee weapons), but the damage bonus can come from either Strength or Agility, whichever is higher.

**Alternate Strike:** Can use secondary attack for different damage type at reduced damage (typically half, rounded down).

**Multi-Type:** Deals full damage with multiple damage types - player chooses which type when attacking.

**Ranged:** For ranged attacks using Ranged Combat skill. Has range increments.
