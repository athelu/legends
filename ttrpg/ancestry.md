# Humans

Humans are creative, imaginative and inventive. There are distinct differences in the various human ethnicities, but they tend to be only differences of physical appearance and do not change the general makeup of humans.

### Ethnicities
Humans can hail from any of the nations or regions on the continent of Estaea. The land of Origin of a human will influence their Native Language and what eye, hair, and skin tone are common. Each of the regions also have unique naming styles.

### Bellicosian
Bellicosians tend to be slightly taller on average, and of fair/pale complexion. Building and clothing styles are Asiatic in inspiration. Bellicosian names follow traditional Germanic and Slavic styles, but fantasy derived names are acceptable as well.

### Coudassian
Coudassians vary in complexion, with the southerners having a honey or coffee complexion and the northerners being more pale. Coudassian names follow Spanish, Portuguese and Italian styles, but fantasy derived names are also acceptable.

### Echartesh
In Appearance the Echartesh have swarthy skin, and long, dark hair. Eyes tend to be light brown, but blue, green, yellow/amber are also seen. Echartesh names follow Jewish and Arabic styles, but fantasy derived names work as well.

### Mersagian
Mersagian populace vary in appearance with the Northerners being quite pale and with all shades of hair and eye color. The Central and southern Meresaw populace tends to be olive skinned with darker hair and eyes. Mersagian names follow traditional English and American styles, but fantasy derived names are acceptable. It is quite possible to have a name from any of the other regions as the kingdom of Meresaw is very cosmopolitan.

### Odani
The Odani people are made up of the Reshi and Tandu tribes. They populate the southern coast of what is considered the Mersaw Kingdom. Their skin is dark, deep shades of black and brown, but eye color tends to be light such as blue, green, amber, or grey.

### Urjack
The Urjack are a solitary people who inhabit the Lackabier peaks mountain range in eastern Estaea. They are taller and broader than most humans from the other realms. Light eye color is common, as well as blonde hair, but browns and reds occur as well.

### Starting Age
While it makes sense that you would want your character to start their adventuring life early, rarely do campaigns span decades of the characters life.
Even Epic campaigns that span multiple years of playing may only take place over year or two of the characters life.
With this in mind, think of the age you envision the character at, regardless of game mechanics. Yes, a 35-year-old grizzled veteran should have better skills and stats but don't get hung up on that, as he will soon get there.

# Elves
In the Third Age, the Goddess Hirnaloyta brought elves into the world of Athelu. Crafted in her image, she imbued in them a love for the world and all its creatures. Elves explored and settled Estaea, building remarkable cities and works of art that blended harmoniously with the nature of the world. The reign of elves was brought short however by the dwarven wars. 

## The Diaspora
Many survivors of the dwarven wars came together to form small, isolated tribes or villages. These small settlements were discovered by the humans as they made their way across Estaea. These small pockets of elvenkind were swallowed up into the human nations they encountered. Having lost their connections to their ancestral past, they worked to find places within these new human realms. 

## The new Elven Kingdom

The people of the Meresaw kingdom were the first to encounter a unified elven nation. The new Elven kingdom rose out of the ashes of the east, beyond the Lockabier peaks. Here they had time to regroup and recover many of their ancestral ways. 
The humans of the Meresaw Kingdom welcomed the elven kingdom, offering peace and trade. Both sides had much to learn, both of the history of Estaea, and of the new Human nations that had arisen from the in the absence of the elves. 
Elves are tall, thin, fair skinned humanoids with pointed ears. They have a delicate and beautiful way about them. Elves may grow light facial hair (mustache or goatee).

### Starting Age 

Elves make the starting age an even tougher discussion. The assumption is that they physically mature at the same pace as humans.
However, anecdotally an elf of less than 100 years would be considered 'Immature'.
Simply decide at what stage of life you envision the character and set your age accordingly. Do not get hung up on the game mechanics of "just starting out" as 120 years old.

### Haiden Elves

Haiden Elves are the stragglers and refugees left behind after the Dwarven War. The march of the Dwarves destroyed almost all Elven kind and their civilization.
The few that were spared fled to safety.  in many cases finding the new cities of Men. Here they were welcomed if a bit warily. Eventually these survivors integrated into this new society, blending parts of their past with this new human culture.
Elves that live within the human nations are typically accepted as regular citizens and have integrated so naturally that there is little Elven culture to distinguish. These elves can benefit from the same Ethnicity options as their human brothers. 
Not being of the same species, mixed marriages can produce no children, so are rare. Elven natural grace and appreciation of beauty finds them many positions in the fine arts. Artist, Poet, Musician and Performer are common occupations for Haiden elves. Many more are accomplished Sorcerers, alchemists, or scholars, with their enviable lifespan allowing them to come to true mastery of these mysteries.
There are a group of elves that have reclaimed the land of their forefathers; rebuilding cities and creating their own nation once again. The kingdom of men, particularly the Kingdom of Meresaw helped these elves rebuild, forging an alliance between the two nations that stands today. 
These elves have more cultural differences from their more human integrated counterparts. Typically, around family structure, traditions, and religious practices.
