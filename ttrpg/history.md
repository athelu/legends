# History of Athelu

## The First Age

### Creation
The gods created Athelu and all the other worlds.  To do so required magic. Magic was woven into everything, all living and non-living things. This allowed the gods to manipulate the world as they saw fit. Many attempts were made, until they all agreed upon a final balance and each God had had their say.

### The Gifts

All manner of flora and fauna was created, but Rudlu encouraged the Gods to make something more cunning, and so the seed for man was sown.  Shu-Jahan insisted that he must impart some wisdom to men, to allow them to grow and steward the world.
Alkira created the laws of nature and those that men must follow. Hirnoloyta balanced man’s need to hunt with flora to gather. Ambis created woman as man's companion. The creation of man pleased and intrigued the gods, who at first interfered in how man interacted with the world.

Encshede convinced the others to let men find their own way. Nevil, silent throughout the process brooded, until he decided that man must be mortal, so that he would know humility and thank the gods for the time he had. 
Thus, was man and his world set into motion. The gods marveled at their wit and cunning in their creations, but as all omnipotent beings, they became bored with this endeavor. They soon saw fit to try creating other worlds. Rudlu took this opportunity to encourage men to explore and learn.

### The Rise of Man

Man strove to become the master of his domain; delving into the secrets that lay in every corner of the world.  The dangers of the magic contained within the world would soon become aware to man. Magic, the very fabric of the elements, of life, and of the Gods’ very own creation was unleashed onto the world.
This life gave itself an identity, for it had lay long on this world - long before men were even a thought. As man tried to master the elements, they found that something greater lay within them.
The elements, full of age and contemptuous of man, created manifestations of themselves to interact with mankind. Arriving as gargantuan creatures to inspire awe the form they chose came to be called dragons by the first men.
As the first daemons to ever enter the world of men the dragons convinced men that they were the masters of all creation. With the departure of the gods, man had no evidence to contradict this claim. 
The Dragons demonstrated their complete mastery of the elements, and so men began to worship them. In so doing, they solidified the existence of the Deamons. No longer were they mere concepts but instead they were imbued with even greater power.

### The Betrayal of Men
The Dragons enticed men into building them great shrines and magnificent cities in their honor. Each act made the Dragons even more powerful. Man scoured Athelu and produced all things precious that it could bear.
The Dragon’s appetites were not sated, and they demanded more. Men produced all manner of great arts to appease the Dragons, but still the Dragons wanted more. When men finally grew weary and pronounced they could give no more, the Dragons took the only thing man had left - their lives.
The Dragons burned, consumed, and slew all men they could find. In their rage, they destroyed the great works that man had created and, in their anger, they brought fire to the very skies. 

## The Second Age

### The Desolation

Athelu, cloaked in ash and smoke, slept. The long winter came and the Dragons were forced into hibernation. With no one left to worship them, they soon returned to their elemental nature, eventually forgetting they were gods and what they had lost.
The gods returned to find their beloved world a shroud. Life nearly forgotten. They brushed the ice and snow to the edges of the world and gazed upon its surface, looking for their creations.
They found little. It appeared that man had consumed himself and was left to live an animal’s life. The gods abandoned their work looking to see if other worlds had suffered similar fates. 

## The Third Age

Hirnaloyta and Athore were not content. They decided that the combined works of the gods had doomed man. So, each saw to their own projects. The face of the world was once again molded, continents and islands pushed to and fro to create something more fitting to their own personal visions. 
Here, on Estaea, they felt something good would grow. Hirnaloyta, presented elves to the world of Athelu. Crafted in her image, she imbued in them a love for the world and all its creatures.

Athore, presented dwarves to the world of Athelu. Crafted in his image, they were imbued with Justice to preserve the world and to do what is right. Rudlu, smiled and watched what the other gods set in motion. Too busy with their own plans, they did not see the tribes of man that had survived. 

## The Fourth Age

### The Survival of Man

Three tribes of men found the shores of Estaea all within 100 years of each other.
The Coudassians landed in the west, the Bellicosians in the south, and the Meresagians in the North. Slowly, they moved into this new world.
Remnants of their old world - the first age - still clung to them; pieces of language, culture and the gods they believed were their saviors.  

### The Meeting of Races

They met the inhabitants of this new world cautiously. Little did they know of the catastrophe about to befall the two great races that lived there. The dwarves, as embodiments of justice, believed it unjust how they could not use magic.
All manner of things on Athelu were made of magic - except for dwarves. Athore in his concern felt that magic was what had corrupted the world, and thought by denying it from his creation they would be safe.
This concern was their undoing. The dwarves dug deep within the world looking for that what had been denied them. Their alchemists, ever capable, uncovered greater and greater secrets until Derhagar, their king, produced Rune magic. 
Not being creatures of magic, dwarves did not understand the balance required for its use. Ever greater and more powerful creations came from the forges. This power, so long out of the hands of the dwarves, corrupted them. In their quest for justice they saw the elves, their brothers, as the reason they had been denied magic for so long. Derhagar unleashed his army and his high chiefs upon an unsuspecting foe. 

### The Dwarven War
The desolation was great. Such destruction and death had not been seen since the first age. Athore, driven near to madness with grief over what his creations had become banished them. He stomped fully upon the high king’s place of power destroying it. The fresh crater of his footstep rushed with his tears and filled, forever hiding the last visible traces of his mistake. 

## The Fifth Age(-3018)

### The Gods Return

In the wake of the destruction, Athore and Hirnaloyta almost gave up hope for Athelu. But Rudlu, Alkira, and Shu-Jahan returned. They said they were called and to the gods’ shock they found the tribes of men, strong in their faith and helping to rebuild Estaea.
Hirnoloyta and Athore were once again brought to men. Enschede and Nevil had no need to return in full; the gift of Enschede is felt by all and Nevil waits to reclaim all creations in the end. 
Man has once again become the master of his domain. The land is subjugated to his will and he chafes at his bonds. The tribes of men, ever restless, now quarrel amongst themselves.
