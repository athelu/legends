# D8 TTRPG - Part 9: Backgrounds

## Background System

Each character chooses one background during character creation. Backgrounds represent your life before adventuring and provide:
- Skill Training: A set of skills with specific ranks (48 XP value)
- Starting Equipment: Basic tools and gear for your profession
- Background Feature: A special ability or social benefit (primarily roleplay-focused)

### Background Patterns

All backgrounds provide exactly 48 XP worth of skills, distributed in one of four patterns, plus additional XP for customization:
- Pattern A (Generalist): 4 skills at rank 2, +24 XP to spend
- Pattern B (Focused): 1 skill at rank 3 + 2 skills at rank 1, +36 XP to spend
- Pattern C (Balanced): 2 skills at rank 2 + 2 skills at rank 1, +40 XP to spend
- Pattern D (Specialist): 1 skill at rank 3 + 1 skill at rank 2, +32 XP to spend

### Backgrounds (Alphabetical)

#### Acolyte
You spent your early days in a religious monastery or cloister. You may have traveled out into the world to spread the message of your faith or because you cast away the teachings of your religion, but deep down you'll always carry within you the lessons you learned. Whether those lessons bring you comfort or haunt you probably depends on the day.

Pattern B (Focused)
- Skills: Religion 3, Empathy 1, History 1, +36 XP
- Equipment: Iron Holy symbol, prayer book, Robe, incense stick x 10, common clothes, shoes
- Feature - Shelter of the Faithful: You can receive free healing and care at temples of your faith.

#### Archaeologist
Crumbling ruins called to you louder than the comforts of civilization. You've spent years piecing together fragments of lost empires, and you know that the greatest treasures aren't gold—they're answers. Adventuring might have started as just another dig, but you've discovered that sometimes the most interesting artifacts are still being used by their current owners.

Pattern D (Specialist)
- Skills: History 3, Investigate 2, +32 XP
- Equipment: journal, map case, traveler's clothes, work boots
- Feature - Historical Insight: When examining ruins or artifacts, the GM will provide one useful historical fact or context clue.

#### Artisan
As an apprentice, you practiced a particular form of building or crafting, developing specialized skill. You might have been a blacksmith's apprentice toiling over the forge for countless hours, a young tailor sewing garments of all kinds, or a shipwright shaping the hulls of ships. Your guild connections remain strong—useful when you need work, materials, or a favor.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Craft 2, Society 2, Persuasion 1, Devices 1, +40 XP
- Equipment: Artisan's tools (choose type), common clothes, belt pouch, shoes
- Feature - Guild Membership: You have connections with artisan guilds. Can find work, get fair prices on materials, and access guild resources in cities.

#### Artist
Your art is your greatest passion, whatever form it takes. Perhaps you adventure for inspiration, or maybe you're just trying to survive until the world recognizes your genius. Either way, you've discovered that wealthy patrons are more interested in artists who have exciting stories to tell—and nothing makes for a better story than a brush with death.

Pattern D (Specialist)
- Skills: Perform 3, Perception 2, +32 XP
- Equipment: Artist's tools, fine clothes, shoes
- Feature - Artistic Reputation: Your work is recognized in certain circles. Can earn money through commissions and gain access to wealthy patrons.

#### Athlete
Years of competition taught you that glory is fleeting but discipline is forever. You might have retired at your peak, or perhaps an injury ended your career prematurely. Either way, you discovered that the training never really stops—it just finds new applications. At least adventuring pays better than most tournaments.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Athletics 2, Acrobatics 2, Perform 1, Intimidate 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: traveler's clothes, backpack, shoes
- Feature - Competitor's Spirit: You're known in sporting circles. Can find competitions, training facilities, and fellow athletes who respect your dedication.

#### Bandit
You took what you needed from those who had more than enough—or at least that's what you told yourself. Whether you rode with a gang or worked alone, the outlaw life taught you skills that polite society condemns but secretly envies. You might be seeking redemption, or you might just be looking for richer targets. Perhaps it's a bit of both.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Stealth 2, Intimidate 2, Wilderness 1, Melee Combat 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Hemp rope, common clothes, low boots
- Feature - Outlaw Network: You know how to find and contact criminal elements in the wilderness and small settlements.

#### Barber
You have three specialties: cutting hair, treating minor wounds, and listening to gossip. People talk freely in your chair, and you've heard everything from marital troubles to murder plots. A good barber knows which secrets to keep, which to share, and when a customer really just needs someone to listen. Your steady hands and sharp razors serve you well in any situation.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Medicine 2, Society 2, Persuasion 1, Devices 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Razor, scissors, comb, soap, common clothes, shoes
- Feature - Gossip Network: People talk freely during grooming. You hear rumors and local news before most others.

#### Barkeep
You poured drinks and kept the peace in an establishment where ale flowed as freely as stories. Every regular had a tale, every stranger brought news from afar, and you were right in the middle of it all. Perhaps business dried up, or maybe you realized that the most interesting stories were happening out there instead of in your taproom. Either way, you know how to read people and make them comfortable—useful skills anywhere.

Pattern A (Generalist)
- Skills: Empathy 2, Persuasion 2, Society 2, Perception 2, +24 XP to spend
- Equipment: Apron, common clothes, shoes
- Feature - Tavern Talk: You know how to listen and learn. Gain Fortune on skill tests when gathering information in drinking establishments.

#### Barrister
Piles of legal manuals, stern teachers, and experience in the courtroom have instructed you in legal matters. You're capable of mounting a prosecution or defense in court, and you tend to keep abreast of local laws—you never know when you might need to talk your way out of trouble on short notice. Or talk your friends out of it, for that matter.

Pattern D (Specialist)
- Skills: Society 3, Persuasion 2, +32 XP to spend
- Equipment: fine clothes, quill, ink, velum parchment x 5, shoes
- Feature - Legal Knowledge: You understand laws and courts. Can navigate legal systems and provide counsel (though not always successfully).

#### Bookkeeper
Numbers don't lie, but the people who record them often do. You spent your days tracking accounts and managing ledgers, developing an eye for discrepancies that most people miss. Perhaps you uncovered an embezzlement scheme that made you unwelcome, or maybe you simply tired of living through other people's finances. Adventure is certainly more exciting than balance sheets, though sometimes the pay isn't as reliable.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Society 2, Investigate 2, Writing 1, Perception 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: journal, ink, quill, abacus, fine clothes, shoes
- Feature - Head for Numbers: You can quickly assess financial records and spot discrepancies or patterns in accounts.

#### Butcher
Your apprenticeship involved sharp knives, practical anatomy, and an understanding of precisely where to cut. The work was bloody, demanding, and surprisingly educational about the vulnerability of living creatures. You might have tired of the smell, or perhaps you realized these skills could be put to more lucrative use. Either way, you know more about sinew and bone than most people ever will.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Might 2, Medicine 2, Craft 1, Society 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Cleaver, apron, meat hook, work clothes, work boots
- Feature - Anatomy Knowledge: You know the best cuts and methods for processing animals, and can apply this knowledge to treating wounds.

#### Carpenter
Every beam tells a story about stress and weight, every joint reveals the skill of its maker. You shaped wood into structures that will outlast you, learning patience and precision in equal measure. Adventuring might represent a departure from your careful craft, but the ability to assess a structure's integrity has saved your life more than once. Wood isn't the only thing that breaks in predictable ways.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Craft 2, Might 2, Devices 1, Perception 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Carpenter's tools, work clothes, work boots, work gloves
- Feature - Structural Assessment: You can quickly evaluate the integrity of wooden structures and identify construction methods.

#### Charlatan
You traveled from place to place, peddling false fortunes in one town, pretending to be a long-lost heir in the next. Becoming an adventurer might be your next big scam or an attempt to put your talents to use for a greater cause. Perhaps it's a bit of both, as you realize that after pretending to be a hero for so long, you've become the mask. Or maybe you're just running from that last con that went sideways.

Pattern A (Generalist)
- Skills: Deception 2, Persuasion 2, Perform 2, Thievery 2, +24 XP to spend
- Equipment: Fine clothes, disguise kit, playing cards, shoes
- Feature - False Identity: You have created a second identity with documentation and can switch between identities convincingly.

#### Cook
You transformed ingredients into something that warmed both body and spirit. Whether you worked in a noble's kitchen with exotic spices or a roadside inn with whatever was available, you understand that a good meal creates community. Adventuring might pay better than kitchen work, but you still find yourself feeding your companions—old habits, and all that. Plus, they're more useful when they're not hungry.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Craft 2, Wilderness 2, Perception 1, Society 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: apron, work clothes, shoes
- Feature - Comfort Food: Meals you prepare during rests grant one additional HP recovery (once per rest, applies to whole party).

#### Courtier
To the common folk, court life seems like an endless parade of balls and banquets. You know better. Every smile hides an agenda, every compliment is calculated, and one misstep can mean social death—or sometimes the regular kind. You learned to navigate these treacherous waters with grace, though whether you're fleeing court intrigue or pursuing it in a new arena is anyone's guess.

Pattern A (Generalist)
- Skills: Persuasion 2, Society 2, Empathy 2, Perform 2, +24 XP to spend
- Equipment: Fine clothes, signet ring, perfume, shoes
- Feature - Court Connections: You know how to navigate noble society. Can gain audience with important figures and understand court politics.

#### Courier
Time was always your enemy. You raced against weather, bandits, and deadlines, carrying messages and packages that others deemed too valuable to trust to slower methods. The pay was decent, the life was exciting, and you saw more of the world than most people dream of. Adventuring is just a logical extension—though now at least you can fight back when someone tries to rob you.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Athletics 2, Society 2, Perception 1, Wilderness 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: traveler's clothes, map case, riding boots
- Feature - Swift Delivery: You know the fastest routes between settlements and can navigate unfamiliar cities quickly.

#### Criminal
As an unscrupulous independent or as a member of an underworld organization, you lived a life of crime. You might have become an adventurer to seek redemption, to escape the law, or simply to get access to bigger and better loot. Your old contacts remain useful, though maintaining those relationships means you're never quite free of your past.

Pattern A (Generalist)
- Skills: Stealth 2, Thievery 2, Deception 2, Intimidate 2, +24 XP to spend
- Equipment: Crowbar, common clothes, belt pouch, wool hood, low boots
- Feature - Criminal Contact: You have a reliable contact in the criminal underworld who can provide information or fence stolen goods.

#### Driver
Long roads, stubborn animals, and all types of weather—you handled them all. Whether hauling cargo for merchants or transporting passengers, you developed a reputation for getting through when others turned back. The work was steady but monotonous, and eventually, you decided that if you were going to risk your life on dangerous roads anyway, you might as well do it for more interesting reasons.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Wilderness 2, Athletics 2, Society 1, Perception 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Whip, traveler's clothes, bedroll, work gloves, work boots
- Feature - Beast Handler: You have expertise with draft animals and vehicles, gaining Fortune when working with them.

#### Entertainer
Through an education in the arts or sheer dogged practice, you learned to entertain crowds. You might have been an actor, a dancer, a musician, a street magician, or any other sort of performer. Adventuring offers new audiences and new material—every dragon you face is another story to tell, every narrow escape is another dramatic moment for future performances.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Perform 2, Persuasion 2, Acrobatics 1, Perception 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: basic Musical instrument, common clothes, disguise kit, shoes
- Feature - By Popular Demand: You can find performance venues and earn money entertaining in most settlements.

#### Farmer
With a strong back and an understanding of seasonal cycles, you tilled the land and tended crops. Your farm could have been razed by invaders, you could have lost the family tying you to the land, or you might have simply tired of the drudgery. Whatever the reason, you left—though you still find yourself reading the weather and judging soil quality out of habit.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Wilderness 2, Might 2, Athletics 1, Craft 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: common clothes, work gloves, work boots
- Feature - Rural Knowledge: You understand seasons, weather, and crops, gaining useful insights about agricultural communities.

#### Fisher
The water was your livelihood and your teacher. Every cast of the net, every reading of the current, every judgment about whether to head out or stay in port—each decision mattered. You might have left because the catches grew thin, or perhaps you realized the biggest fish weren't in the water at all. Either way, patience is a virtue you've mastered, and the sea's lessons apply to more than just fishing.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Wilderness 2, Athletics 2, Perception 1, Craft 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: net, common clothes, shoes
- Feature - Water Sense: You understand water, tides, and aquatic life, gaining Fortune on related skill checks.

#### Gambler
The thrill of the win drew you into games of chance, though you know that in the long run, the house always wins—unless you cheat, and you definitely know how to do that. This might have been a lucrative sideline that paled in comparison to the real risks of adventuring, or you might have fallen on hard times and pursued adventuring as a way out of debt. At least when you gamble with your life, the odds are more honest.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Deception 2, Empathy 2, Perception 1, Society 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Dice set, playing cards, common clothes, shoes
- Feature - Never Tell the Odds: You have a knack for reading people during games of chance and can spot loaded dice or marked cards.

#### Guard
You served in the guard, standing watch while others slept. You know the boredom of endless patrols punctuated by moments of sudden terror. Whether you left because of corruption in the ranks, disagreements with your commander, or simple wanderlust, you still think like a guard—always watching, always anticipating trouble. Old habits die hard, and honestly, they've kept you alive more than once.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Melee Combat 2, Perception 2, Intimidate 1, Society 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Spear or club, uniform, manacles, work gloves, work boots
- Feature - Watchful Eye: You're trained to spot trouble. Can identify suspicious behavior and know guard procedures in most settlements.

#### Herbalist
As a formally trained apothecary or a rural practitioner of folk medicine, you learned the healing properties of various herbs. You're adept at collecting the right natural cures in all sorts of environments and preparing them properly. Some people think your work is witchcraft, others call it science, but patients rarely care about the distinction when your remedies work. Adventuring gives you access to rare specimens you could never afford before.

Pattern D (Specialist)
- Skills: Medicine 3, Wilderness 2, +32 XP to spend
- Equipment: Herbalism kit, mortar and pestle, common clothes, shoes
- Feature - Plant Lore: You can identify useful plants and create basic remedies. Medicine checks to treat poison have Fortune.

#### Hermit
In an isolated place—like a cave, remote oasis, or secluded mansion—you lived a life of solitude. Adventuring might represent your first foray out among other people in some time. This might be a welcome reprieve from solitude or an unwanted change, but in either case, you're likely still rough around the edges. What drove you to isolation—and what drove you back out—are questions you might still be answering.

Pattern B (Focused)
- Skills: Wilderness 3, Medicine 1, Religion 1, +36 XP to spend
- Equipment: robe, herbalism kit, shoes
- Feature - Solitary Discovery: During your isolation, you discovered something significant (work with GM). People seek your wisdom, though they may not understand it.

#### Hunter
You stalked and took down animals and other creatures of the wild. Skinning animals, harvesting their flesh, and cooking them were also part of your training, all of which can give you useful resources while you adventure. The skills transfer remarkably well—whether you're tracking a deer or a bandit, the principles are the same. You just have to hope the prey doesn't shoot back.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Wilderness 2, Ranged Combat 2, Stealth 1, Perception 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Bow or crossbow, arrows/bolts, high boots, work clothes, work gloves
- Feature - Tracker: You can track creatures through wilderness and gain Fortune on Wilderness checks to follow trails or identify animal signs.

#### Investigator
You made your living uncovering truths that others wanted hidden. Whether working for law enforcement, private clients, or simply satisfying your own curiosity, you developed a reputation for finding answers. Perhaps a case went wrong, or maybe you discovered something that made staying in one place dangerous. Either way, your skills at noticing details and following leads are invaluable, even if your companions find your constant questions irritating.

Pattern D (Specialist)
- Skills: Investigate 3, Perception 2, +32 XP to spend
- Equipment: Magnifying glass, journal, ink, quill, fine clothes, shoes
- Feature - Keen Mind: When examining a crime scene or mystery, the GM will provide one crucial clue or detail others might miss.

#### Laborer
You've spent years performing arduous physical labor. It was a difficult life, but you somehow survived. You may have embraced adventuring as an easier method to make your way in the world, or you might adventure under someone else's command. At least now when you're risking your life, there's treasure involved instead of just a copper a day and aching muscles.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Might 2, Athletics 2, Constitution saves 1, Craft 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Work clothes, work gloves, work boots
- Feature - Hard Worker: You can find manual labor work in any settlement and are trusted by working folk.

#### Merchant
In a dusty shop, market stall, or merchant caravan, you bartered wares for coin and trade goods. The skills you picked up still apply in the adventuring life, where a good deal on a suit of armor could prevent your death. You understand that everything has a price—information, loyalty, even lives—and knowing how to negotiate can be as important as knowing how to fight.

Pattern A (Generalist)
- Skills: Persuasion 2, Society 2, Empathy 2, Investigate 2, +24 XP to spend
- Equipment: fine clothes, journal, quill, ink, shoes
- Feature - Trade Network: You have contacts in merchant guilds and can find buyers or sellers for most goods.

#### Mercenary
Bringing in lawbreakers or fighting in petty wars lined your pockets. Maybe you had an altruistic motive and genuinely believed in your employers' causes, or maybe the coin was motivation enough. Your techniques for staying alive in combat transfer easily to adventuring, though at least now you can choose your battles. Most of the time, anyway.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Melee Combat 2, Athletics 2, Intimidate 1, Wilderness 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Weapon of choice, common clothes, work boots
- Feature - Soldier of Fortune: You can find mercenary work and are recognized by other sellswords. Know how to negotiate contracts and identify legitimate employers.

#### Miner
You earned a living wrenching precious minerals from the lightless depths of the earth. Adventuring might have seemed lucrative or glamorous compared to this backbreaking labor—and if you have to head back underground, this time you plan to do so armed with a real weapon instead of a miner's pick. At least now the things trying to kill you might be guarding treasure instead of just being cave-ins.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Might 2, Athletics 2, Perception 1, Craft 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: lantern, work clothes, Hemp rope, work boots
- Feature - Underground Sense: You can navigate underground spaces and identify minerals and stone quality. Gain Fortune on checks related to underground environments.

#### Noble
To the common folk, the life of a noble seems one of idyllic luxury, but growing up as a noble or member of the aspiring gentry, you know the reality: a noble's lot is obligation and intrigue. Whether you seek to escape your duties by adventuring or to better your station, you have traded silks and pageantry for an adventurer's life. The question is whether your family sees this as honorable service or scandalous rebellion.

Pattern B (Focused)
- Skills: Society 3, Persuasion 1, History 1, +36 XP to spend
- Equipment: Fine clothes, signet ring, shoes
- Feature - Position of Privilege: You are of noble birth. Common folk defer to you, and you can secure audiences with authorities, though this may also make you a target.

#### Nomad
Traveling far and wide, you picked up basic tactics for surviving on the road and in unknown lands, getting by with few supplies and even fewer comforts. As an adventurer, you travel still, often into even more dangerous places. The difference is that now you have companions—and you're not sure yet whether that makes things easier or more complicated.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Wilderness 2, Athletics 2, Perception 1, Society 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Tent, traveler's clothes, hemp rope, waterskin, work boots
- Feature - Wanderer's Knowledge: You know routes and shortcuts across wilderness and can find nomadic communities for trade or information.

#### Refugee
You fled your homeland due to war, disaster, or persecution. Everything you knew was torn away, but somehow you survived. Perhaps you're searching for a new home, or maybe you're trying to earn enough to reclaim what was lost. Either way, the experience taught you that survival requires both strength and flexibility, and you learned never to take safety for granted.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Stealth 2, Wilderness 2, Empathy 1, Society 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: common clothes, bedroll, shoes
- Feature - Survivor's Instinct: You know how to avoid danger and find help. Can identify safe havens and sympathetic people in unfamiliar places.

#### Sage
You have a knack for learning about the arcane arts, and sequestered yourself from the outside world to learn all you could. You read about so many wondrous places and things in your books, and always dreamed about one day seeing the real things. Eventually, that curiosity led you to leave your studies and become an adventurer. Or perhaps you were forced out when an experiment went spectacularly wrong.

Pattern D (Specialist)
- Skills: Arcane 3, History 2, +32 XP to spend
- Equipment: General topic Book, quill, ink papyrus parchment x 5, robe, shoes
- Feature - Researcher: You know how to find information in libraries and archives, and have contacts among scholars who can provide access or assistance.

#### Sailor
You heard the call of the sea from a young age. Perhaps you signed onto a merchant's vessel, joined the navy, or even fell in with a crew of pirates and scalawags. Life at sea taught you to work as part of a crew and stay steady when solid ground is just a memory. You might be on land now, but the ocean never really lets go of those who've sailed her waters.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Athletics 2, Acrobatics 2, Perception 1, Wilderness 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: limbe bast Rope, common clothes, belt knife, shoes
- Feature - Ship Passage: You can secure free or reduced passage on ships and are welcomed in port taverns. Sailors recognize and trust one of their own.

#### Scholar
You have a knack for learning, and sequestered yourself from the outside world to learn all you could. You read about so many wondrous places and things in your books, and always dreamed about one day seeing the real things. Eventually, that curiosity led you to leave your studies and become an adventurer. The reality is often messier and more dangerous than the books suggested, but at least it's never boring.

Pattern D (Specialist)
- Skills: History 3, Society 2, +32 XP to spend
- Equipment: general topic book, quill, ink papyrus parchment x 5, robe, shoes
- Feature - Academic Network: You have connections with universities and scholars, allowing you to access libraries, seek expert advice, and be recognized in academic circles.

#### Servant
You served in a noble household or wealthy establishment, learning to be efficient, discreet, and above all, invisible. A good servant sees everything and says nothing—at least not where their employer can hear. You might have left seeking independence, or perhaps you learned something that made staying dangerous. Either way, you know how to blend in and how to listen, skills that prove surprisingly useful in adventuring.

Pattern A (Generalist)
- Skills: Empathy 2, Society 2, Perception 2, Stealth 2, +24 XP to spend
- Equipment: Uniform or livery, common clothes, shoes
- Feature - Invisible Presence: Servants are often overlooked. You can blend into servile settings and gain access to places where servants are expected but not noticed.

#### Shepherd
You spent long days and nights watching over flocks, responsible for their safety in all weather and against all threats. The work was solitary but never truly lonely—animals have their own language if you learn to listen. You might have left when the flock was lost, or perhaps you simply realized that protecting people pays better than protecting sheep. The principles are the same, though people complain more.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Wilderness 2, Perception 2, Athletics 1, Medicine 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: sling, common clothes, waterskin, blanket, shoes
- Feature - Animal Empathy: You understand animal behavior and can calm domesticated animals, predict their actions, and gain their trust more easily.

#### Smith
Fire, hammer, and patience—these were your tools and your teachers. You shaped metal into tools, weapons, and art, learning that true craftsmanship cannot be rushed. Perhaps business dried up, or maybe you tired of making swords for others to wield. Either way, you understand the value of good equipment, and you know how to keep it maintained in the field. Your companions will thank you for that.

Pattern D (Specialist)
- Skills: Craft 3, Might 2, +32 XP to spend
- Equipment: Smith's tools, hammer, apron, work gloves, work clothes, work boots
- Feature - Master Craftsman: You can repair weapons and armor in the field, assess metal quality and craftsmanship, and create or modify metal items with proper materials and time.

#### Smuggler
You learned to move goods past customs agents, border guards, and other obstacles that stand between supply and demand. The work required nerve, connections, and intimate knowledge of routes that authorities don't patrol. You might have gone straight, or maybe you just started smuggling more interesting cargo. Either way, knowing how to slip past authority has its uses, even in an honest profession. If such a thing exists.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Stealth 2, Deception 2, Society 1, Perception 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: common clothes, hemp rope, low boots
- Feature - Hidden Routes: You know smuggling routes, secret passages, and which officials can be bribed in settlements you've worked in. Can find black market contacts.

#### Soldier
In your younger days, you waded into battle as part of an organized military force. You might have wanted to break out from the regimented structure of these forces, or you could have always been as independent a warrior as you are now. The discipline remains, though, along with the understanding that sometimes the only way forward is straight through. Your service taught you that courage and stupidity often look the same from the outside.

Pattern B (Focused)
- Skills: Melee Combat 3, Athletics 1, Intimidate 1, +36 XP to spend
- Equipment: Uniform, weapon of choice, bedroll, high boots, common clothes
- Feature - Military Rank: You have (or had) rank in an army. Can secure lodging at military posts, understand military protocols, and are recognized by fellow soldiers.

#### Squire
You served a knight or noble warrior, learning combat, chivalry, and the responsibilities that come with wielding power. The training was rigorous, the ideals were lofty, and the reality often fell short of both. Perhaps you earned your spurs and now seek your own path, or maybe you're still waiting for that moment of recognition. Either way, you carry those lessons with you, for better or worse.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Melee Combat 2, Athletics 2, Society 1, Empathy 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: weapon of choice, fine clothes, riding boots
- Feature - Knight's Training: You were trained in chivalry and combat. Recognized by noble warriors and can invoke codes of honor, though results vary by region and culture.

#### Tailor
Fabric, thread, and needle were your tools, and with them you created everything from simple work clothes to elaborate gowns. You learned that clothes speak volumes about their wearer—status, wealth, taste, even personality. This eye for detail serves you well in any situation, whether you're creating a disguise, assessing a stranger, or simply appreciating fine craftsmanship. Plus, you're the only one who can repair the party's torn gear.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Craft 2, Society 2, Perception 1, Persuasion 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Sewing kit, fine clothes, shoes
- Feature - Fashion Sense: You understand clothing and status. Can identify someone's social position by their attire, create convincing disguises, and know current fashion trends.

#### Teacher
You dedicated yourself to sharing knowledge with others, whether in a formal school or as a private tutor. The work taught you patience, clarity, and the understanding that every student learns differently. Perhaps funding dried up, or maybe you realized that the biggest lessons aren't found in books. Either way, you still find yourself explaining things to your companions—old habits die hard, even when they're trying to kill a dragon.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Society 2, History 2, Persuasion 1, Empathy 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: general topic book, quill, ink, robes, papyrus parchment x 5, shoes
- Feature - Educator: You can explain complex topics simply and effectively. When teaching skills to others, they learn faster (GM discretion on mechanical benefits).

#### Urchin
You eked out a living by picking pockets on the streets of a major city, never knowing where you'd find your next meal. While some folk adventure for the glory, you do so to survive—though at least now survival involves more interesting challenges than avoiding the city watch. The streets were your teacher, and they taught you lessons that no school could provide. Most of them involved running.

Pattern A (Generalist)
- Skills: Stealth 2, Thievery 2, Acrobatics 2, Society 2, +24 XP to spend
- Equipment: common clothes, belt knife
- Feature - Street Connections: You know the streets and alleys of cities. Can find urchin informants, navigate urban areas quickly, and identify safe places to hide or sleep.

#### Ward
You were raised in a noble or wealthy household, educated and cared for but never quite family. The experience gave you access to privilege while reminding you constantly that it could be taken away. You learned etiquette, history, and the subtle art of navigating high society from the margins. Now you're free to make your own way, though whether that freedom is liberating or terrifying probably depends on the day.

Pattern C (Balanced)
- Skills: Society 2, History 2, Empathy 1, Perception 1, +40 XP to spend
- Equipment: Fine clothes, general topic book, quill, ink, velum parchment x 2, shoes
- Feature - Noble Education: You were raised in a noble household and understand etiquette and high society, though you lack the full privileges and recognition that true nobles command.

#### Weaver
