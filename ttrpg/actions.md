Reactions are special responses triggered by specific circumstances that occur outside your turn.

- **Additional Reactions:** Some feats, equipment, and weaves grant additional reaction options beyond those listed here

### Universal Reactions

All characters have access to these reactions:

#### Opportunity Attack [Combat] (Reaction)
- **Trigger:** A hostile creature you can see moves out of your melee reach
- **Effect:** Make one melee attack against the triggering creature
- **Resolution:** Roll your Melee Combat skill normally. This attack uses your reaction for the round.

### Reaction Priority and Timing

When multiple creatures have reactions that could trigger simultaneously:

3. If still tied, reactions resolve simultaneously

### Important Clarifications

**You cannot:**
- Take more than one reaction per round
- Use a reaction on your own turn (except for specific triggered abilities)
- Ready a reaction "just in case" - reactions only trigger from specific circumstances

**You can:**
- Use your reaction before your first turn in initiative order (unless Surprised)
- Choose not to use your reaction when triggered
- Use different reactions on different rounds (if you have access to multiple reaction types)
