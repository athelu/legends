The Magical Gift
“Gifted” is the term used for magic users, both Arcane and Divine casters. The gift is nothing more than one being able to open their pneuma to the planes and allowing the magical energies to flow through them.
The term “Arcanist” is campaign setting specific and applies to all arcane magic users. Arcane magic users are broken down further into two categories: Mages and Diabolists.
Mages are born with a permanent bond to the planes that can strengthen and grow over time. This connection is constant and resonates with their pneuma which in turn causes the eyes of mages to always glow with magical light. 
Arcanists that can learn to access arcane powers or have been gifted them through some other means are called Diabolists. 
Divine casters are latent magic users that can be trained to access their magical gift but require faith and a focus to complete the connection.
Arcane and Divine connections are the opposite sides of a coin. Arcanists tap into the same wild, raw elemental and magical forces as the Divine, but through a different method. 
While wielding these magic energies, Arcane magic users describe much the same emotions and sensations that their Divine counterparts do: Euphoria, Elation, Intoxication, Joy, Inspiration. 
For the divine casters these feelings are felt upon the completion of the ritual or prayer. A divine caster’s eyes will glow like an arcanists, but only upon the completion of the spell. 
Regardless of the physical changes of the magic user, all magical effects produce a violet light whether it be magical flame, magical writing, magical barriers etc. Magical weapons will likewise produce light of this color.
Magic in this world is anything but subtle and it is the same for its practitioners. Magic effects are very showy, leaving motes of energy, symbols, and other telltale signs that can be interpreted by those who can detect magic.
Necromancy
The Necromantic arts are  lost to the current inhabitant of Athelu. Player characters should be forbidden from taking any weaves with the [Necromantic] keyword. Necromancy is a part of the knowledge of the First men that has been lost to time. It is up to the DM to determine if this knowledge can be recovered, but if I can be it should only be done during gameplay, exploration, or finding some trove of ancient knowledge.
The first men knew the Necromantic arts well from their study of pneuma, and how it calls to the Daemons outside the physical realm.
Necromanctic magic has a tarnishing effect upon the Pneuma of the user. The daemons that are attracted are more selfish or vile, and further influence the mind of the Magic user. 

## Arcane Casters
Arcanists that are born with innate magical power are called Mages. Both Mages and Diabolists are further refined into more specific categories. To reflect this, the traditional list of available classes has been modified:

### Arcanists - clast equivelant
| Type | Class |
|------|-------|
| Mage | Sorcerer |
| Mage | Wizard |
| Diabolist | Artificer |
| Diabolist | Invoker |
| Diabolist | Warlock |

Mages represent the most populace group of Arcanists. The practices vary from land to land, but arcanists born with innate magical ability are identifiable upon birth. Their pupils and iris are no longer visible, their eyes instead glow with a distinct purple light. 
Within each culture - some action is taken upon the birth of a mage. It normally involves having the child placed within a learning institution that will teach the mage how to harness their abilities.
This could be placement with an established magical college, or given to the local wise woman, but all people understand that when they find a newborn mage, it is essential they are brought somewhere to teach them. 
Not all Mages are able to learn to use their magic the same way - and it requires skill and training to identify how to best teach a mage. Some mages access the arcane through their understanding of the world and their intellect. Others harness their arcane power through the sheer force of their personal identity.  This distinction represents the next levels of classification of mages: The Wizard and the Sorcerer. 
Wizards create magic through very careful study of the world around them - not just the physical world or the prime material, but the outer realms of the planes as well. It is through a clear understanding (at least to the mage) of how these components interact that allows them to exploit their connections to create magical effects. 
Sorcerers, on the other hand, have such an indomitable sense of self that they can produce magical effects almost from sheer force of will alone. Sorcerers are so confident in their place in the universe that it would be anathema for the universe to deny them access to such powers. Sorcerers need not understand fully where their power comes from, only that it is available to them. 
Sorcerers and Wizards have such a divergent understanding of magic that they cannot learn to master their abilities in the same way. A person born with innate magical ability will only succeed in controlling their power once they understand how they need to access it.  Although the resultant magical effect may be the same, the way a wizard and a sorcerer accomplish the feat are not the same. 
Diabolists are often misunderstood - if not feared. The people of the world have come to expect the arcane to announce itself through glowing eyes. Diabolists do not have an innate magical ability - but instead are awakened.
Some major trauma or event normally spurs this awakening. At some point the diabolist is forced to access power outside of themselves to survive or accomplish some greater deed. Diabolists are rare because the circumstances surrounding their awakening are rare - or in most cases fatal. 
Near death experience is the most consistent method of awakening; Someone subjected to such stress and trauma that they open themselves up to anything to save themselves.
These events create diabolists known as Warlocks. Warlocks will often have a tale of how they came into their powers but most commonly it will involve having someone - or something - grant them the strength they needed to survive.
This outside force is called a patron. Warlocks and their patrons are forever linked. The warlock gets their magical ability and their power from this connection. Like Divine casters, the eyes of a warlock glow with the familiar magical light only upon the completion of their magic. 
Other diabolists are researchers of the arcane. Though not having an innate magical ability, there are many who attempt to understand the arcane with a philosophical approach. These researchers can discover pieces of magic interwoven into everyday life.
Artificers are diabolists who have discovered links between rare elements, symbols, and magic. Through clever craftsmanship and skill, artificers can fuse magical energy into their creations.
Invokers are diabolists that have discovered the connection between the spoken word and magic. This connection may not be fully understood, and in some cases may even be accidental. These words often are not of any spoken language and are rarely words used in the incantations of other arcanists - but these sounds have power when spoken by an invoker.
