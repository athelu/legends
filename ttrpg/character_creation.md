## Character Creation Steps

1. **Determine Attributes**
2. **Choose Background**
3. **Choose Ancestry**
4. **Select Traits and Flaws**
5. **Select 2 Starting Feats**
6. **Spend Starting XP**
7. **Calculate Hit Points**
8. **Select Starting Equipment**


## 1. Determine Attributes

### Random roll
8d8, assign as desired

### Starting Attribute Array

Players assign the following values to their eight attributes: 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2

## 2. Choose Background

Characters must choose a background from the ones available in the Background section or they may roll for a random background. This will determine some starting gear as well as skills.

### Random Background Table (d88)

Roll 2d8 - first die is the "tens" digit, second die is the "ones" digit.

| Roll | Background | Roll | Background |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| 11 | Acolyte | 51 | Nomad |
| 12 | Archaeologist | 52 | Refugee |
| 13 | Artisan | 53 | Sage |
| 14 | Artist | 54 | Sailor |
| 15 | Athlete | 55 | Scholar |
| 16 | Bandit | 56 | Servant |
| 17 | Barber | 57 | Shepherd |
| 18 | Barkeep | 58 | Smith |
| 21 | Barrister | 61 | Smuggler |
| 22 | Bookkeeper | 62 | Soldier |
| 23 | Butcher | 63 | Squire |
| 24 | Carpenter | 64 | Tailor |
| 25 | Charlatan | 65 | Teacher |
| 26 | Cook | 66 | Urchin |
| 27 | Courtier | 67 | Ward |
| 28 | Courier | 68 | Weaver |
| 31 | Criminal | 71 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 32 | Driver | 72 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 33 | Entertainer | 73 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 34 | Farmer | 74 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 35 | Fisher | 75 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 36 | Gambler | 76 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 37 | Guard | 77 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 38 | Herbalist | 78 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 41 | Hermit | 81 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 42 | Hunter | 82 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 43 | Investigator | 83 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 44 | Laborer | 84 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 45 | Merchant | 85 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 46 | Mercenary | 86 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 47 | Miner | 87 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 48 | Noble | 88 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |

**How to Use:**
1. Roll 2d8 (different colors recommended - one for "tens", one for "ones")
2. First die = tens digit (1-8), second die = ones digit (1-8)
3. Combine for your result (e.g., rolling 3 and 5 = 35 = Fisher)
4. If you roll 71-88, reroll or choose any background that fits your character concept

**Examples:**
- Roll 4 and 2 = 42 = Hunter
- Roll 1 and 8 = 18 = Barkeep  
- Roll 6 and 3 = 63 = Squire
- Roll 7 and 5 = 75 = Reroll (pick any background)

## 3. Determine Ancestry

The player must choose an ancestry from those available in the ancestry.md file. The Selction of Dwarf would require special permission from the DM due to the history of the world. 

## 4. Flaws & Traits

Review the flaws.md and traits.md. You MUST choose Flaws in order to earn points to spend on Traits. All magic using characters require a trait (between 5-7 points). You may not spend more points on traits than you have earned from flaws.

#### Core Rule
-   Traits cost points
-   Flaws grant points
-   To take a trait, you must have equal or greater flaw points
-   Character creation only - cannot be taken after initial creation

#### Traits
Traits are primarily for:
-   **Magical abilities** - granting Energy pools, Mastery skills, and weaving capability
-   **Unique resource systems** - such as Lay on Hands pools or Sorcery Points
-   **Exceptional characteristics** - supernatural heritage, extreme longevity, etc.

Most combat abilities, class features, and martial techniques are now available as **feats** rather than traits.


## 5. Starting Feats

Every character receives **2 free feats** at character creation. These represent your foundational training and abilities. Choose feats that:
-   Define your character concept (Martial Combatant, rogue, monk, etc.)
-   Meet your prerequisite requirements
-   Complement each other mechanically

These starting feats do NOT count against your tier feat limits.

## 6. Spend starting XP

Each character will have XP to spend that varies based upon the background selected. 

All skills begin at rank 0 (untrained). Your chosen Background (see Part 9: Backgrounds) provides skill training.

This XP can be spent in the following ways:

##### Gain New Skill: 4 xp
-   **Example:** Rank 0→1 costs 4 XP

##### Increasing Skills: 8 × current rank
-   **Example:** Rank 2→3 costs 16 XP
-   **Note:** Skill CANNOT exceed the value of the linked Attribute. Skills max at 8 ranks

##### Attributes: 16 × current rank (double skill cost)
-   **Example:** Rank 3→4 costs 48 XP
-   **Note:** Attribute cannot exceed 8

##### Potentials: 16 × current rank (same as attributes, only for characters with magical abilities)
-   **Example:** Fire Potential 5→6 costs 80 XP
-   **Note:** Mastery CANNOT exceed the value of the engery Potential. Mastery max at 8 ranks

##### Feats: 40 XP each
-   Tier limits: Maximum purchased feats = 2 per tier
-   Starting feats (2 free) do NOT count against tier limits
-   **Example:** Tier 3 character can have 2 starting + 6 purchased = 8 total feats


## 7. Calculate Hit Points

### Hit Points
HP = Constitution × 8

Hit points do NOT increase with level/tier. Characters become harder to hit (better skills/attributes) rather than able to sustain more damage.


## 8. Select Starting Equipment

There are two options for deciding starting wealth for characters:
    1. 150 gp
    2. roll 3d8 x 10
