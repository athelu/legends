# D8 TTRPG - Part 2: Character Creation

## Character Attributes

### The Eight Core Attributes (1-8 scale)
1.  Strength - Physical power, lifting, breaking
2.  Constitution - Health, endurance, resilience
3.  Agility - Speed, reflexes, combat movement
4.  Dexterity - Fine motor skills, precision, crafting
5.  Intelligence - Reasoning, knowledge, magical theory
6.  Wisdom - Intuition, perception, spiritual connection
7.  Charisma - Personality, leadership, social influence
8.  Luck - Fortune, fate, cosmic favor

## Character Creation Steps

1. **Determine Attributes**
2. **Choose Background**
3. **Select Traits and Flaws**
4. **Select 2 Starting Feats**
5. **Spend Starting XP**
6. **Calculate Hit Points**
7. **Select Starting Equipment**


## Determine Attributes

### Random roll
8d8, assign as desired

### Starting Attribute Array

Players assign the following values to their eight attributes: 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2

### Hit Points
HP = Constitution × 8

Hit points do NOT increase with level/tier. Characters become harder to hit (better skills/attributes) rather than able to sustain more damage.

### Starting Skills

All skills begin at rank 0 (untrained). Your chosen Background (see Part 9: Backgrounds) provides skill training.

Each background grants 48 XP worth of skills in one of four patterns, plus additional XP to spend:
-   Pattern A (Generalist): 4 skills at rank 2, +40 XP to spend
-   Pattern B (Focused): 1 skill at rank 3 + 2 skills at rank 1, +40 XP to spend
-   Pattern C (Balanced): 2 skills at rank 2 + 2 skills at rank 1, +40 XP to spend
-   Pattern D (Specialist): 1 skill at rank 3 + 1 skill at rank 2, +40 XP to spend

Spending Background XP:
-   Can be spent on skills or saved toward feats
-   Rank 0→1 costs 4 XP
-   Rank 1→2 costs 8 XP
-   Rank 2→3 costs 16 XP
-   One feat costs 40 XP

#### Skill Limits
-   Skills cannot exceed their governing attribute value
-   Maximum skill rank: 8

### Starting Feats

Every character receives **2 free feats** at character creation. These represent your foundational training and abilities. Choose feats that:
-   Define your character concept (fighter, rogue, monk, etc.)
-   Meet your prerequisite requirements
-   Complement each other mechanically

**Examples:**
-   Fighter concept: Action Surge + Second Wind
-   Rogue concept: Sneak Attack + Cunning Action
-   Monk concept: Unarmored Defense + Flurry of Blows
-   Barbarian concept: Rage + Unarmored Defense
-   Archer concept: Precise Shot + Hunter's Mark

These starting feats do NOT count against your tier feat limits.

### Traits and Flaws (Advantages/Disadvantages)

#### Core Rule
-   Traits cost points
-   Flaws grant points
-   To take a trait, you must have equal or greater flaw points
-   Character creation only - cannot be taken after initial creation

#### Traits
Traits are primarily for:
-   **Magical abilities** - granting Energy pools, Mastery skills, and weaving capability
-   **Unique resource systems** - such as Lay on Hands pools or Sorcery Points
-   **Exceptional characteristics** - supernatural heritage, extreme longevity, etc.

Most combat abilities, class features, and martial techniques are now available as **feats** rather than traits.

### Character Advancement

#### Experience Points (XP)
-   XP per session: 24 XP (awarded equally to all players)
-   XP can be spent to increase attributes, skills, Potentials (if magical), or purchase feats

#### Improvement Costs

##### Gain New Skill: 4 xp
-   **Example:** Rank 0→1 costs 4 XP

##### Increasing Skills: 8 × current rank
-   **Example:** Rank 2→3 costs 16 XP

##### Attributes: 16 × current rank (double skill cost)
-   **Example:** Rank 3→4 costs 48 XP

##### Potentials: 16 × current rank (same as attributes, only for characters with magical abilities)
-   **Example:** Fire Potential 5→6 costs 80 XP

##### Feats: 40 XP each
-   Tier limits: Maximum purchased feats = 2 per tier
-   Starting feats (2 free) do NOT count against tier limits
-   **Example:** Tier 3 character can have 2 starting + 6 purchased = 8 total feats

### Character Tiers

#### Characters progress through 8 power tiers based on total XP invested:

| Tier | XP Range | Sessions (24/session) | Max Feats | D&D Equivalent |
|------|----------|----------------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | 0–120 | ~5 | 2 start + 2 purchased | Levels 1–2 |
| 2 | 120–360 | ~10 | 2 start + 4 purchased | Levels 3–5 |
| 3 | 360–600 | ~10 | 2 start + 6 purchased | Levels 6–8 |
| 4 | 600–840 | ~10 | 2 start + 8 purchased | Levels 9–11 |
| 5 | 840–1080 | ~10 | 2 start + 10 purchased | Levels 12–14 |
| 6 | 1080–1320 | ~10 | 2 start + 12 purchased | Levels 15–17 |
| 7 | 1320–1560 | ~10 | 2 start + 14 purchased | Levels 18–19 |
| 8 | 1560+ | ~10+ | 2 start + 16 purchased | Level 20 |

##### Notes on Feat Limits:
-   The 2 starting feats are FREE and do NOT count against tier limits
-   Tier limits apply only to feats purchased with XP
-   This allows characters to grow from 4 feats (Tier 1) to 18 feats (Tier 8)
-   Characters can still mix and match feat types freely (martial + magical, etc.)

##### Progression Rate: At 24 XP per session:
-   Tier 1→2: ~5 sessions
-   Tier 2→3: ~10 sessions
-   Tier 3→4: ~10 sessions
-   Tier 4→5: ~10 sessions
-   Tier 5→6: ~10 sessions
-   Tier 6→7: ~10 sessions
-   Tier 7→8: ~10 sessions
