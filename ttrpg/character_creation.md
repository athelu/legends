## Character Attributes

### The Eight Core Attributes (1-8 scale)
Strength represents raw physical power and the capacity to exert force upon the world. It governs feats of lifting, pushing, breaking, and overpowering obstacles through sheer muscle. In combat, Strength determines the damage dealt with melee weapons and the ability to grapple or shove opponents. Those with high Strength can carry heavy loads without encumbrance, force open stuck doors, and bend iron bars.

Constitution measures overall health, stamina, and physical resilience. It determines how much punishment a character can endure before falling unconscious and how quickly they recover from exhaustion, disease, and poison. Constitution governs a character's ability to maintain physical exertion over extended periods, from forced marches to swimming against strong currents. Those with exceptional Constitution can fight through injuries that would fell lesser individuals and resist environmental extremes.

Agility encompasses speed, reflexes, and dynamic movement—especially in high-pressure situations like combat. It governs initiative in battle, the ability to dodge attacks, and movement through difficult terrain. Agility determines acrobatic feats, from tumbling past enemies to maintaining balance on precarious surfaces. Characters with high Agility strike quickly, react to danger before others perceive it, and move with fluid grace through chaotic melee.

Dexterity represents fine motor control, precision, and careful manipulation. It governs delicate tasks requiring steady hands and exact movements: picking locks, disarming traps, crafting intricate items, and performing sleight of hand. In combat, Dexterity applies to ranged attacks and the wielding of finesse weapons that favor precision over power. Those with exceptional Dexterity can perform surgery, forge masterwork items, and hit targets at extreme range.

Intelligence measures analytical reasoning, learned knowledge, and the capacity to understand complex systems. It governs magical theory, arcane spellcasting, and the retention of scholarly information across all fields of study. Intelligence determines how quickly a character learns new skills, solves puzzles, and identifies patterns others might miss. Those with high Intelligence excel at investigation, recall obscure facts under pressure, and grasp the fundamental principles underlying magic and nature.

Wisdom represents intuition, awareness, and connection to forces beyond pure reason. It governs perception of both the physical world and spiritual truths, from noticing hidden dangers to understanding the will of the cosmos. Wisdom determines divine spellcasting, insight into others' motivations, and the ability to survive in the wilderness. Those with exceptional Wisdom sense deception, read situations accurately, and maintain mental clarity when others succumb to fear or confusion.

Charisma embodies force of personality, social influence, and the power of conviction. It governs leadership, persuasion, deception, and intimidation—the ability to change minds and hearts through presence alone. Charisma determines performance ability and certain forms of innate magic that draw power from willpower rather than study or faith. Those with high Charisma inspire loyalty, command attention in any gathering, and bend social situations to their advantage.

Luck represents cosmic favor, synchronicity, and the mysterious force that tips probability in one's favor. Unlike other attributes, Luck operates as both a score and a renewable resource, allowing characters to influence fate at critical moments. It governs the unpredictable elements of existence: stumbling upon useful items at opportune times, surviving against impossible odds, and experiencing fortunate coincidences. Those blessed with high Luck seem protected by fate itself, while those who deplete their Luck reserve tempt disaster.

## Character Creation Steps

1. **Determine Attributes**
2. **Choose Ancestry**
3. **Choose Background**
4. **Select Traits and Flaws**
5. **Select 2 Starting Feats**
6. **Spend Starting XP**
7. **Calculate Hit Points**
8. **Select Starting Equipment**



## Step 1: Determine Attributes
There are two standard methods available for determining your characters eight core attributes.
**Random roll:** Roll 8d8. This becomes your attribute pool. You may assign as desired to the core attributes.
**Standard Array:** Players assign the following values to their core attributes: 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2

## Step 2. Determine Ancestry
The player must choose an ancestry from those available in the ancestry section.

## Step 3. Choose Background
Characters must choose a background from the ones available in the Background section or they may roll for a random background. This will determine some starting gear as well as skills.

### Random Background Table (d88)

Roll 2d8 - first die is the "tens" digit, second die is the "ones" digit.

| 47 | Miner | 87 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 48 | Noble | 88 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |

## Step 4. Flaws & Traits
Review the Flaws and Traits section. You MUST choose Flaws in order to earn points to spend on Traits. All magic using characters require a trait that costs between 5-7 points. You may not spend more points on traits than you have earned from flaws.
To take a trait, you must have equal or greater flaw points. Traits and Flaws are ONLY available during Character creation, and cannot be taken after initial creation.
Traits are primarily for Magical abilities, granting Energy pools, Mastery skills, and weaving capability and for Exceptional characteristics such as supernatural heritage, extreme longevity, etc.

## Step 5. Starting Feats
Every character receives 2 free feats at character creation. These represent your foundational training and abilities. Choose feats that define your character concept and help you meet your prerequisite requirements for the type of character that you have in mind. Many feats complement each other mechanically, or build upon each other.
These starting feats do NOT count against your tier feat limits.

## Step 6. Spend starting XP
Each character will have XP to spend during their character creation. This is how you choose specific improvements to aid in your character concept. The amount of XP you will have to spend varies based upon the background selected.
This XP can be spent in the following ways:
- **Gain New Skill:** 4 xp
- **Increasing Skill rank:** 8 × current rank
- **Attributes:** 16 × current rank
- **Potentials:** 16 × current rank
- **Feats:** 40 XP each

## Step 7. Calculate Hit Points
HP = Constitution × 8
Hit points do NOT increase with level/tier. Characters become harder to hit (better skills/attributes) rather than able to sustain more damage.

## Step 8. Select Starting Equipment
There are two options for deciding starting wealth for characters: Default 150 gp pr roll 3d8 x 10 gp.
