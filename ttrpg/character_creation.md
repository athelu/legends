## Character Attributes

### The Eight Core Attributes (1-8 scale)
Strength represents raw physical power and the capacity to exert force upon the world. It governs feats of lifting, pushing, breaking, and overpowering obstacles through sheer muscle. In combat, Strength determines the damage dealt with melee weapons and the ability to grapple or shove opponents. Those with high Strength can carry heavy loads without encumbrance, force open stuck doors, and bend iron bars.

Constitution measures overall health, stamina, and physical resilience. It determines how much punishment a character can endure before falling unconscious and how quickly they recover from exhaustion, disease, and poison. Constitution governs a character's ability to maintain physical exertion over extended periods, from forced marches to swimming against strong currents. Those with exceptional Constitution can fight through injuries that would fell lesser individuals and resist environmental extremes.

Agility encompasses speed, reflexes, and dynamic movement—especially in high-pressure situations like combat. It governs initiative in battle, the ability to dodge attacks, and movement through difficult terrain. Agility determines acrobatic feats, from tumbling past enemies to maintaining balance on precarious surfaces. Characters with high Agility strike quickly, react to danger before others perceive it, and move with fluid grace through chaotic melee.

Dexterity represents fine motor control, precision, and careful manipulation. It governs delicate tasks requiring steady hands and exact movements: picking locks, disarming traps, crafting intricate items, and performing sleight of hand. In combat, Dexterity applies to ranged attacks and the wielding of finesse weapons that favor precision over power. Those with exceptional Dexterity can perform surgery, forge masterwork items, and hit targets at extreme range.

Intelligence measures analytical reasoning, learned knowledge, and the capacity to understand complex systems. It governs magical theory, arcane spellcasting, and the retention of scholarly information across all fields of study. Intelligence determines how quickly a character learns new skills, solves puzzles, and identifies patterns others might miss. Those with high Intelligence excel at investigation, recall obscure facts under pressure, and grasp the fundamental principles underlying magic and nature.

Wisdom represents intuition, awareness, and connection to forces beyond pure reason. It governs perception of both the physical world and spiritual truths, from noticing hidden dangers to understanding the will of the cosmos. Wisdom determines divine spellcasting, insight into others' motivations, and the ability to survive in the wilderness. Those with exceptional Wisdom sense deception, read situations accurately, and maintain mental clarity when others succumb to fear or confusion.

Charisma embodies force of personality, social influence, and the power of conviction. It governs leadership, persuasion, deception, and intimidation—the ability to change minds and hearts through presence alone. Charisma determines performance ability and certain forms of innate magic that draw power from willpower rather than study or faith. Those with high Charisma inspire loyalty, command attention in any gathering, and bend social situations to their advantage.

Luck represents cosmic favor, synchronicity, and the mysterious force that tips probability in one's favor. Unlike other attributes, Luck operates as both a score and a renewable resource, allowing characters to influence fate at critical moments. It governs the unpredictable elements of existence: stumbling upon useful items at opportune times, surviving against impossible odds, and experiencing fortunate coincidences. Those blessed with high Luck seem protected by fate itself, while those who deplete their Luck reserve tempt disaster.

## Character Creation Steps

1. **Determine Attributes**
2. **Choose Background**
3. **Choose Ancestry**
4. **Select Traits and Flaws**
5. **Select 2 Starting Feats**
6. **Spend Starting XP**
7. **Calculate Hit Points**
8. **Select Starting Equipment**


## 1. Determine Attributes

### Random roll
8d8, assign as desired

### Starting Attribute Array

Players assign the following values to their eight attributes: 5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2

## 2. Choose Background

Characters must choose a background from the ones available in the Background section or they may roll for a random background. This will determine some starting gear as well as skills.

### Random Background Table (d88)

Roll 2d8 - first die is the "tens" digit, second die is the "ones" digit.

| Roll | Background | Roll | Background |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| 11 | Acolyte | 51 | Nomad |
| 12 | Archaeologist | 52 | Refugee |
| 13 | Artisan | 53 | Sage |
| 14 | Artist | 54 | Sailor |
| 15 | Athlete | 55 | Scholar |
| 16 | Bandit | 56 | Servant |
| 17 | Barber | 57 | Shepherd |
| 18 | Barkeep | 58 | Smith |
| 21 | Barrister | 61 | Smuggler |
| 22 | Bookkeeper | 62 | Soldier |
| 23 | Butcher | 63 | Squire |
| 24 | Carpenter | 64 | Tailor |
| 25 | Charlatan | 65 | Teacher |
| 26 | Cook | 66 | Urchin |

| 47 | Miner | 87 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |
| 48 | Noble | 88 | Reroll (Player's Choice) |

**How to Use:**
1. Roll 2d8 (different colors recommended - one for "tens", one for "ones")
2. First die = tens digit (1-8), second die = ones digit (1-8)
3. Combine for your result (e.g., rolling 3 and 5 = 35 = Fisher)
4. If you roll 71-88, reroll or choose any background that fits your character concept

**Examples:**
- Roll 4 and 2 = 42 = Hunter
- Roll 1 and 8 = 18 = Barkeep  
- Roll 6 and 3 = 63 = Squire
- Roll 7 and 5 = 75 = Reroll (pick any background)

## 3. Determine Ancestry

The player must choose an ancestry from those available in the ancestry.md file. The Selction of Dwarf would require special permission from the DM due to the history of the world. 

## 4. Flaws & Traits

Review the flaws.md and traits.md. You MUST choose Flaws in order to earn points to spend on Traits. All magic using characters require a trait (between 5-7 points). You may not spend more points on traits than you have earned from flaws.

#### Core Rule
-   Traits cost points
-   Flaws grant points
-   To take a trait, you must have equal or greater flaw points
-   Character creation only - cannot be taken after initial creation

#### Traits
Traits are primarily for:
-   **Magical abilities** - granting Energy pools, Mastery skills, and weaving capability
-   **Exceptional characteristics** - supernatural heritage, extreme longevity, etc.


## 5. Starting Feats

Every character receives **2 free feats** at character creation. These represent your foundational training and abilities. Choose feats that:
-   Define your character concept
-   Meet your prerequisite requirements
-   Complement each other mechanically

These starting feats do NOT count against your tier feat limits.

## 6. Spend starting XP

Each character will have XP to spend that varies based upon the background selected. 

All skills begin at rank 0 (untrained). Your chosen Background (see Part 9: Backgrounds) provides skill training.

This XP can be spent in the following ways:

##### Gain New Skill: 4 xp
-   **Example:** Rank 0→1 costs 4 XP

##### Increasing Skills: 8 × current rank
-   **Example:** Rank 2→3 costs 16 XP
-   **Note:** Skill CANNOT exceed the value of the linked Attribute. Skills max at 8 ranks

##### Attributes: 16 × current rank (double skill cost)
-   **Example:** Rank 3→4 costs 48 XP
-   **Note:** Attribute cannot exceed 8

##### Potentials: 16 × current rank (same as attributes, only for characters with magical abilities)
-   **Example:** Fire Potential 5→6 costs 80 XP
-   **Note:** Mastery CANNOT exceed the value of the engery Potential. Mastery max at 8 ranks

##### Feats: 40 XP each
-   Tier limits: Maximum purchased feats = 2 per tier
-   Starting feats (2 free) do NOT count against tier limits
-   **Example:** Tier 3 character can have 2 starting + 6 purchased = 8 total feats


## 7. Calculate Hit Points

### Hit Points
HP = Constitution × 8

Hit points do NOT increase with level/tier. Characters become harder to hit (better skills/attributes) rather than able to sustain more damage.


## 8. Select Starting Equipment

There are two options for deciding starting wealth for characters:
    1. 150 gp
    2. roll 3d8 x 10
